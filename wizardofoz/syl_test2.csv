Dorothy
3
lived
1
in
1
the
1
midst
1
of
1
the
1
great
2
Kansas
2
prairies
2
with
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
who
1
was
1
a
1
farmer
2
and
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
who
1
was
1
the
1
farmer
2
's
0
wife
1
Their
1
house
1
was
1
small
1
for
1
the
1
lumber
2
to
1
build
1
it
1
had
1
to
1
be
1
carried
2
by
1
wagon
2
many
2
miles
1
There
1
were
1
four
1
walls
1
a
1
floor
1
and
1
a
1
roof
1
which
1
made
1
one
1
room
1
and
1
this
1
room
1
contained
2
a
1
rusty
2
looking
2
cookstove
2
a
1
cupboard
2
for
1
the
1
dishes
1
a
1
table
1
three
1
or
1
four
1
chairs
1
and
1
the
1
beds
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
and
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
had
1
a
1
big
1
bed
0
in
1
one
1
corner
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
a
1
little
1
bed
0
in
1
another
3
corner
2
There
1
was
1
no
1
garret
2
at
1
all
1
and
1
no
1
cellar
2
except
2
a
1
small
1
hole
1
dug
1
in
1
the
1
ground
1
called
1
a
1
cyclone
2
cellar
2
where
1
the
1
family
3
could
1
go
1
in
1
case
1
one
1
of
1
those
1
great
2
whirlwinds
2
arose
2
mighty
2
enough
2
to
1
crush
1
any
2
building
2
in
1
its
1
path
1
It
1
was
1
reached
2
by
1
a
1
trap
1
door
1
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
floor
1
from
1
which
1
a
1
ladder
2
led
0
down
1
into
2
the
1
small
1
dark
1
hole
1
When
1
Dorothy
3
stood
1
in
1
the
1
doorway
2
and
1
looked
1
around
2
she
0
could
1
see
1
nothing
2
but
1
the
1
great
2
gray
1
prairie
2
on
1
every
3
side
1
Not
1
a
1
tree
1
nor
1
a
1
house
1
broke
1
the
1
broad
1
sweep
1
of
1
flat
1
country
2
that
1
reached
2
to
1
the
1
edge
1
of
1
the
1
sky
1
in
1
all
1
directions
3
The
1
sun
1
had
1
baked
1
the
1
plowed
1
land
1
into
2
a
1
gray
1
mass
1
with
1
little
1
cracks
1
running
2
through
1
it
1
Even
2
the
1
grass
1
was
1
not
1
green
1
for
1
the
1
sun
1
had
1
burned
1
the
1
tops
1
of
1
the
1
long
1
blades
1
until
2
they
1
were
1
the
1
same
1
gray
1
color
2
to
1
be
1
seen
1
everywhere
4
Once
1
the
1
house
1
had
1
been
1
painted
1
but
1
the
1
sun
1
blistered
2
the
1
paint
1
and
1
the
1
rains
1
washed
1
it
1
away
2
and
1
now
1
the
1
house
1
was
1
as
1
dull
1
and
1
gray
1
as
1
everything
4
else
1
When
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
came
1
there
1
to
1
live
1
she
0
was
1
a
1
young
1
pretty
2
wife
1
The
1
sun
1
and
1
wind
1
had
1
changed
1
her
1
too
1
They
1
had
1
taken
2
the
1
sparkle
1
from
1
her
1
eyes
0
and
1
left
1
them
1
a
1
sober
2
gray
1
they
1
had
1
taken
2
the
1
red
0
from
1
her
1
cheeks
1
and
1
lips
1
and
1
they
1
were
1
gray
1
also
2
She
0
was
1
thin
1
and
1
gaunt
1
and
1
never
2
smiled
1
now
1
When
1
Dorothy
3
who
1
was
1
an
1
orphan
2
first
1
came
1
to
1
her
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
had
1
been
1
so
1
startled
1
by
1
the
1
child
1
's
0
laughter
2
that
1
she
0
would
1
scream
2
and
1
press
1
her
1
hand
1
upon
2
her
1
heart
2
whenever
3
Dorothy
3
's
0
merry
2
voice
1
reached
2
her
1
ears
2
and
1
she
0
still
1
looked
1
at
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
with
1
wonder
2
that
1
she
0
could
1
find
1
anything
3
to
1
laugh
1
at
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
never
2
laughed
1
He
1
worked
1
hard
1
from
1
morning
2
till
1
night
1
and
1
did
1
not
1
know
1
what
1
joy
1
was
1
He
1
was
1
gray
1
also
2
from
1
his
1
long
1
beard
2
to
1
his
1
rough
1
boots
1
and
1
he
1
looked
1
stern
1
and
1
solemn
2
and
1
rarely
3
spoke
1
It
1
was
1
Toto
2
that
1
made
1
Dorothy
3
laugh
1
and
1
saved
1
her
1
from
1
growing
2
as
1
gray
1
as
1
her
1
other
2
surroundings
3
Toto
2
was
1
not
1
gray
1
he
1
was
1
a
1
little
1
black
1
dog
1
with
1
long
1
silky
2
hair
1
and
1
small
1
black
1
eyes
0
that
1
twinkled
1
merrily
3
on
1
either
2
side
1
of
1
his
1
funny
2
wee
1
nose
1
Toto
2
played
0
all
1
day
1
long
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
played
0
with
1
him
1
and
1
loved
1
him
1
dearly
3
Today
2
however
3
they
1
were
1
not
1
playing
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
sat
1
upon
2
the
1
doorstep
2
and
1
looked
1
anxiously
3
at
1
the
1
sky
1
which
1
was
1
even
2
grayer
1
than
1
usual
2
Dorothy
3
stood
1
in
1
the
1
door
1
with
1
Toto
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
and
1
looked
1
at
1
the
1
sky
1
too
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
was
1
washing
2
the
1
dishes
1
From
1
the
1
far
1
north
1
they
1
heard
2
a
1
low
1
wail
1
of
1
the
1
wind
1
and
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
could
1
see
1
where
1
the
1
long
1
grass
1
bowed
1
in
1
waves
1
before
2
the
1
coming
2
storm
1
There
1
now
1
came
1
a
1
sharp
1
whistling
2
in
1
the
1
air
1
from
1
the
1
south
1
and
1
as
1
they
1
turned
1
their
1
eyes
0
that
1
way
1
they
1
saw
1
ripples
1
in
1
the
1
grass
1
coming
2
from
1
that
1
direction
3
also
2
Suddenly
3
Uncle
1
Henry
2
stood
1
up
1
There
1
's
0
a
1
cyclone
2
coming
2
Em
1
he
1
called
1
to
1
his
1
wife
1
I
1
'll
0
go
1
look
1
after
2
the
1
stock
1
Then
1
he
1
ran
1
toward
2
the
1
sheds
1
where
1
the
1
cows
1
and
1
horses
1
were
1
kept
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
dropped
1
her
1
work
1
and
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
door
1
One
1
glance
1
told
1
her
1
of
1
the
1
danger
2
close
1
at
1
hand
1
Quick
1
Dorothy
3
she
0
screamed
2
Run
1
for
1
the
1
cellar
2
Toto
2
jumped
1
out
1
of
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
arms
1
and
1
hid
1
under
2
the
1
bed
0
and
1
the
1
girl
1
started
1
to
1
get
1
him
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
badly
2
frightened
2
threw
1
open
2
the
1
trap
1
door
1
in
1
the
1
floor
1
and
1
climbed
1
down
1
the
1
ladder
2
into
2
the
1
small
1
dark
1
hole
1
Dorothy
3
caught
1
Toto
2
at
1
last
1
and
1
started
1
to
1
follow
2
her
1
aunt
1
When
1
she
0
was
1
halfway
2
across
2
the
1
room
1
there
1
came
1
a
1
great
2
shriek
2
from
1
the
1
wind
1
and
1
the
1
house
1
shook
1
so
1
hard
1
that
1
she
0
lost
1
her
1
footing
2
and
1
sat
1
down
1
suddenly
3
upon
2
the
1
floor
1
Then
1
a
1
strange
1
thing
1
happened
2
The
1
house
1
whirled
1
around
2
two
1
or
1
three
1
times
1
and
1
rose
1
slowly
2
through
1
the
1
air
1
Dorothy
3
felt
1
as
1
if
1
she
0
were
1
going
1
up
1
in
1
a
1
balloon
2
The
1
north
1
and
1
south
1
winds
1
met
1
where
1
the
1
house
1
stood
1
and
1
made
1
it
1
the
1
exact
2
center
2
of
1
the
1
cyclone
2
In
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
a
1
cyclone
2
the
1
air
1
is
1
generally
4
still
1
but
1
the
1
great
2
pressure
2
of
1
the
1
wind
1
on
1
every
3
side
1
of
1
the
1
house
1
raised
1
it
1
up
1
higher
2
and
1
higher
2
until
2
it
1
was
1
at
1
the
1
very
2
top
1
of
1
the
1
cyclone
2
and
1
there
1
it
1
remained
2
and
1
was
1
carried
2
miles
1
and
1
miles
1
away
2
as
1
easily
4
as
1
you
1
could
1
carry
2
a
1
feather
3
It
1
was
1
very
2
dark
1
and
1
the
1
wind
1
howled
1
horribly
3
around
2
her
1
but
1
Dorothy
3
found
1
she
0
was
1
riding
2
quite
1
easily
4
After
2
the
1
first
1
few
1
whirls
1
around
2
and
1
one
1
other
2
time
1
when
1
the
1
house
1
tipped
1
badly
2
she
0
felt
1
as
1
if
1
she
0
were
1
being
1
rocked
1
gently
2
like
1
a
1
baby
2
in
1
a
1
cradle
1
Toto
2
did
1
not
1
like
1
it
1
He
1
ran
1
about
2
the
1
room
1
now
1
here
1
now
1
there
1
barking
2
loudly
2
but
1
Dorothy
3
sat
1
quite
1
still
1
on
1
the
1
floor
1
and
1
waited
1
to
1
see
1
what
1
would
1
happen
2
Once
1
Toto
2
got
1
too
1
near
2
the
1
open
2
trap
1
door
1
and
1
fell
1
in
1
and
1
at
1
first
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
thought
1
she
0
had
1
lost
1
him
1
But
1
soon
1
she
0
saw
1
one
1
of
1
his
1
ears
2
sticking
2
up
1
through
1
the
1
hole
1
for
1
the
1
strong
1
pressure
2
of
1
the
1
air
1
was
1
keeping
2
him
1
up
1
so
1
that
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
fall
1
She
0
crept
1
to
1
the
1
hole
1
caught
1
Toto
2
by
1
the
1
ear
2
and
1
dragged
1
him
1
into
2
the
1
room
1
again
2
afterward
3
closing
2
the
1
trap
1
door
1
so
1
that
1
no
1
more
1
accidents
3
could
1
happen
2
Hour
1
after
2
hour
1
passed
1
away
2
and
1
slowly
2
Dorothy
3
got
1
over
2
her
1
fright
1
but
1
she
0
felt
1
quite
1
lonely
3
and
1
the
1
wind
1
shrieked
2
so
1
loudly
2
all
1
about
2
her
1
that
1
she
0
nearly
3
became
2
deaf
2
At
1
first
1
she
0
had
1
wondered
2
if
1
she
0
would
1
be
1
dashed
1
to
1
pieces
2
when
1
the
1
house
1
fell
1
again
2
but
1
as
1
the
1
hours
1
passed
1
and
1
nothing
2
terrible
2
happened
2
she
0
stopped
1
worrying
2
and
1
resolved
2
to
1
wait
1
calmly
2
and
1
see
1
what
1
the
1
future
2
would
1
bring
1
At
1
last
1
she
0
crawled
1
over
2
the
1
swaying
1
floor
1
to
1
her
1
bed
0
and
1
lay
1
down
1
upon
2
it
1
and
1
Toto
2
followed
2
and
1
lay
1
down
1
beside
2
her
1
In
1
spite
1
of
1
the
1
swaying
1
of
1
the
1
house
1
and
1
the
1
wailing
2
of
1
the
1
wind
1
Dorothy
3
soon
1
closed
1
her
1
eyes
0
and
1
fell
1
fast
1
asleep
2
She
0
was
1
awakened
3
by
1
a
1
shock
1
so
1
sudden
2
and
1
severe
2
that
1
if
1
Dorothy
3
had
1
not
1
been
1
lying
1
on
1
the
1
soft
1
bed
0
she
0
might
1
have
1
been
1
hurt
1
As
1
it
1
was
1
the
1
jar
1
made
1
her
1
catch
1
her
1
breath
2
and
1
wonder
2
what
1
had
1
happened
2
and
1
Toto
2
put
1
his
1
cold
1
little
1
nose
1
into
2
her
1
face
1
and
1
whined
1
dismally
3
Dorothy
3
sat
1
up
1
and
1
noticed
2
that
1
the
1
house
1
was
1
not
1
moving
2
nor
1
was
1
it
1
dark
1
for
1
the
1
bright
1
sunshine
2
came
1
in
1
at
1
the
1
window
2
flooding
2
the
1
little
1
room
1
She
0
sprang
1
from
1
her
1
bed
0
and
1
with
1
Toto
2
at
1
her
1
heels
1
ran
1
and
1
opened
2
the
1
door
1
The
1
little
1
girl
1
gave
1
a
1
cry
1
of
1
amazement
4
and
1
looked
1
about
2
her
1
her
1
eyes
0
growing
2
bigger
2
and
1
bigger
2
at
1
the
1
wonderful
3
sights
1
she
0
saw
1
The
1
cyclone
2
had
1
set
1
the
1
house
1
down
1
very
2
gently
2
for
1
a
1
cyclone
2
in
1
the
1
midst
1
of
1
a
1
country
2
of
1
marvelous
3
beauty
3
There
1
were
1
lovely
3
patches
1
of
1
greensward
2
all
1
about
2
with
1
stately
3
trees
0
bearing
3
rich
1
and
1
luscious
2
fruits
1
Banks
1
of
1
gorgeous
2
flowers
2
were
1
on
1
every
3
hand
1
and
1
birds
1
with
1
rare
1
and
1
brilliant
3
plumage
2
sang
1
and
1
fluttered
2
in
1
the
1
trees
0
and
1
bushes
1
A
1
little
1
way
1
off
1
was
1
a
1
small
1
brook
1
rushing
2
and
1
sparkling
2
along
2
between
2
green
1
banks
1
and
1
murmuring
3
in
1
a
1
voice
1
very
2
grateful
3
to
1
a
1
little
1
girl
1
who
1
had
1
lived
1
so
1
long
1
on
1
the
1
dry
1
gray
1
prairies
2
While
1
she
0
stood
1
looking
2
eagerly
4
at
1
the
1
strange
1
and
1
beautiful
4
sights
1
she
0
noticed
2
coming
2
toward
2
her
1
a
1
group
1
of
1
the
1
queerest
2
people
1
she
0
had
1
ever
2
seen
1
They
1
were
1
not
1
as
1
big
1
as
1
the
1
grown
1
folk
1
she
0
had
1
always
2
been
1
used
1
to
1
but
1
neither
2
were
1
they
1
very
2
small
1
In
1
fact
1
they
1
seemed
1
about
2
as
1
tall
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
who
1
was
1
a
1
well-grown
2
child
1
for
1
her
1
age
1
although
2
they
1
were
1
so
1
far
1
as
1
looks
1
go
1
many
2
years
2
older
2
Three
1
were
1
men
1
and
1
one
1
a
1
woman
2
and
1
all
1
were
1
oddly
2
dressed
1
They
1
wore
1
round
1
hats
1
that
1
rose
1
to
1
a
1
small
1
point
1
a
1
foot
1
above
2
their
1
heads
2
with
1
little
1
bells
1
around
2
the
1
brims
1
that
1
tinkled
1
sweetly
2
as
1
they
1
moved
1
The
1
hats
1
of
1
the
1
men
1
were
1
blue
0
the
1
little
1
woman
2
's
0
hat
1
was
1
white
1
and
1
she
0
wore
1
a
1
white
1
gown
1
that
1
hung
1
in
1
pleats
2
from
1
her
1
shoulders
2
Over
2
it
1
were
1
sprinkled
1
little
1
stars
1
that
1
glistened
2
in
1
the
1
sun
1
like
1
diamonds
3
The
1
men
1
were
1
dressed
1
in
1
blue
0
of
1
the
1
same
1
shade
1
as
1
their
1
hats
1
and
1
wore
1
well-polished
3
boots
1
with
1
a
1
deep
1
roll
1
of
1
blue
0
at
1
the
1
tops
1
The
1
men
1
Dorothy
3
thought
1
were
1
about
2
as
1
old
1
as
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
for
1
two
1
of
1
them
1
had
1
beards
2
But
1
the
1
little
1
woman
2
was
1
doubtless
2
much
1
older
2
Her
1
face
1
was
1
covered
2
with
1
wrinkles
1
her
1
hair
1
was
1
nearly
3
white
1
and
1
she
0
walked
1
rather
2
stiffly
2
When
1
these
1
people
1
drew
1
near
2
the
1
house
1
where
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
standing
2
in
1
the
1
doorway
2
they
1
paused
1
and
1
whispered
2
among
2
themselves
2
as
1
if
1
afraid
2
to
1
come
1
farther
2
But
1
the
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
walked
1
up
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
made
1
a
1
low
1
bow
1
and
1
said
1
in
1
a
1
sweet
1
voice
1
You
1
are
1
welcome
2
most
1
noble
1
Sorceress
3
to
1
the
1
land
1
of
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
We
1
are
1
so
1
grateful
3
to
1
you
1
for
1
having
2
killed
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
and
1
for
1
setting
2
our
1
people
1
free
1
from
1
bondage
2
Dorothy
3
listened
2
to
1
this
1
speech
1
with
1
wonder
2
What
1
could
1
the
1
little
1
woman
2
possibly
3
mean
2
by
1
calling
2
her
1
a
1
sorceress
3
and
1
saying
1
she
0
had
1
killed
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
Dorothy
3
was
1
an
1
innocent
3
harmless
2
little
1
girl
1
who
1
had
1
been
1
carried
2
by
1
a
1
cyclone
2
many
2
miles
1
from
1
home
1
and
1
she
0
had
1
never
2
killed
1
anything
3
in
1
all
1
her
1
life
1
But
1
the
1
little
1
woman
2
evidently
4
expected
2
her
1
to
1
answer
2
so
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
with
1
hesitation
4
You
1
are
1
very
2
kind
1
but
1
there
1
must
1
be
1
some
1
mistake
2
I
1
have
1
not
1
killed
1
anything
3
Your
1
house
1
did
1
anyway
3
replied
2
the
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
with
1
a
1
laugh
1
and
1
that
1
is
1
the
1
same
1
thing
1
See
1
she
0
continued
2
pointing
2
to
1
the
1
corner
2
of
1
the
1
house
1
There
1
are
1
her
1
two
1
feet
1
still
1
sticking
2
out
1
from
1
under
2
a
1
block
1
of
1
wood
1
Dorothy
3
looked
1
and
1
gave
1
a
1
little
1
cry
1
of
1
fright
1
There
1
indeed
1
just
1
under
2
the
1
corner
2
of
1
the
1
great

Oh

cried
1
Dorothy
3
clasping
2
her
1
hands
1
together
3
in
1
dismay
2
The

house

must
1
have
1
fallen
2
on

her
1
Whatever

shall
1
we

do
1
There

is
1
nothing
2
to

done
1
said
1
the

little

woman

calmly
2
But
1
who
1
was
1
she
0
asked
1
Dorothy
3
She
0
was
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
as
1
I
1
said
1
answered
2
the
1
little
1
woman
2
She
0
has
1
held
1
all
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
in
1
bondage
2
for
1
many
2
years
2
making
2
them
1
slave
1
for
1
her
1
night
1
and
1
day
1
Now
1
they
1
are
1
all
1
set
1
free
1
and
1
are
1
grateful
3
to
1
you
1
for
1
the
1
favor
2
Who
1
are
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
inquired
2
Dorothy
3
They
1
are
1
the
1
people
1
who
1
live
1
in
1
this
1
land
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
where
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
ruled
1
Are
1
you
1
a
1
Munchkin
2
asked
1
Dorothy
3
No
1
but
1
I
1
am
1
their
1
friend
2
although
2
I
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
land
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
When
1
they
1
saw
1
the
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
was
1
dead
2
the
1
Munchkins
2
sent
1
a
1
swift
1
messenger
3
to
1
me
1
and
1
I
1
came
1
at
1
once
1
I
1
am
1
the
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
Oh
1
gracious
2
cried
1
Dorothy
3
Are
1
you
1
a
1
real
2
witch
1
Yes
0
indeed
1
answered
2
the
1
little
1
woman
2
But
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
good
1
witch
1
and
1
the
1
people
1
love
1
me
1
I
1
am
1
not
1
as
1
powerful
3
as
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
was
1
who
1
ruled
1
here
1
or
1
I
1
should
1
have
1
set
1
the
1
people
1
free
1
myself
2
But
1
I
1
thought
1
all
1
witches
1
were
1
wicked
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
who
1
was
1
half
1
frightened
2
at
1
facing
2
a
1
real
2
witch
1
Oh
1
no
1
that
1
is
1
a
1
great
2
mistake
2
There
1
were
1
only
2
four
1
witches
1
in
1
all
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
and
1
two
1
of
1
them
1
those
1
who
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
North
1
and
1
the
1
South
1
are
1
good
1
witches
1
I
1
know
1
this
1
is
1
true
0
for
1
I
1
am
1
one
1
of
1
them
1
myself
2
and
1
can
1
not
1
be
1
mistaken
3
Those
1
who
1
dwelt
1
in
1
the
1
East
2
and
1
the
1
West
1
were
1
indeed
1
wicked
1
witches
1
but
1
now
1
that
1
you
1
have
1
killed
1
one
1
of
1
them
1
there
1
is
1
but
1
one
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
in
1
all
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
the
1
one
1
who
1
lives
1
in
1
the
1
West
1
But
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
after
2
a
1
moment
2
's
0
thought
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
has
1
told
1
me
1
that
1
the
1
witches
1
were
1
all
1
dead
2
years
2
and
1
years
2
ago
2
Who
1
is
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
inquired
2
the
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
She
0
is
1
my
1
aunt
1
who
1
lives
1
in
1
Kansas
2
where
1
I
1
came
1
from
1
The
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
seemed
1
to
1
think
1
for
1
a
1
time
1
with
1
her
1
head
2
bowed
1
and
1
her
1
eyes
0
upon
2
the
1
ground
1
Then
1
she
0
looked
1
up
1
and
1
said
1
I
1
do
1
not
1
know
1
where
1
Kansas
2
is
1
for
1
I
1
have
1
never
2
heard
2
that
1
country
2
mentioned
2
before
2
But
1
tell
1
me
1
is
1
it
1
a
1
civilized
3
country
2
Oh
1
yes
0
replied
2
Dorothy
3
Then
1
that
1
accounts
2
for
1
it
1
In
1
the
1
civilized
3
countries
2
I
1
believe
3
there
1
are
1
no
1
witches
1
left
1
nor
1
wizards
2
nor
1
sorceresses
3
nor
1
magicians
4
But
1
you
1
see
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
has
1
never
2
been
1
civilized
3
for
1
we
1
are
1
cut
1
off
1
from
1
all
1
the
1
rest
1
of
1
the
1
world
1
Therefore
3
we
1
still
1
have
1
witches
1
and
1
wizards
2
amongst
2
us
1
Who
1
are
1
the
1
wizards
2
asked
1
Dorothy
3
Oz
1
himself
2
is
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
answered
2
the
1
Witch
1
sinking
2
her
1
voice
1
to
1
a
1
whisper
2
He
1
is
1
more
1
powerful
3
than
1
all
1
the
1
rest
1
of
1
us
1
together
3
He
1
lives
1
in
1
the
1
City
2
of
1
Emeralds
3
Dorothy
3
was
1
going
1
to
1
ask
1
another
3
question
2
but
1
just
1
then
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
who
1
had
1
been
1
standing
2
silently
3
by
1
gave
1
a
1
loud
1
shout
1
and
1
pointed
1
to
1
the
1
corner
2
of
1
the
1
house
1
where
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
had
1
been
1
lying
1
What
1
is
1
it
1
asked
1
the
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
and
1
looked
1
and
1
began
2
to
1
laugh
1
The
1
feet
1
of
1
the
1
dead
2
Witch
1
had
1
disappeared
4
entirely
4
and
1
nothing
2
was
1
left
1
but
1
the
1
silver
2
shoes
0
She
0
was
1
so
1
old
1
explained
2
the
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
that
1
she
0
dried
1
up
1
quickly
2
in
1
the
1
sun
1
That
1
is
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
her
1
But
1
the
1
silver
2
shoes
0
are
1
yours
1
and
1
you
1
shall
1
have
1
them
1
to
1
wear
2
She
0
reached
2
down
1
and
1
picked
1
up
1
the
1
shoes
0
and
1
after
2
shaking
2
the
1
dust
1
out
1
of
1
them
1
handed
1
them
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
The
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
was
1
proud
1
of
1
those
1
silver
2
shoes
0
said
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
and
1
there
1
is
1
some
1
charm
1
connected
2
with
1
them
1
but
1
what
1
it
1
is
1
we
1
never
2
knew
1
Dorothy
3
carried
2
the
1
shoes
0
into
2
the
1
house
1
and
1
placed
1
them
1
on
1
the
1
table
1
Then
1
she
0
came
1
out
1
again
2
to
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
and
1
said
1
I
1
am
1
anxious
2
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
my
1
aunt
1
and
1
uncle
1
for
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
they
1
will
1
worry
2
about
2
me
1
Can
1
you
1
help
1
me
1
find
1
my
1
way
1
The
1
Munchkins
2
and
1
the
1
Witch
1
first
1
looked
1
at
1
one
1
another
3
and
1
then
1
at
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
then
1
shook
1
their
1
heads
2
At
1
the
1
East
2
not
1
far
1
from
1
here
1
said
1
one
1
there
1
is
1
a
1
great
2
desert
2
and
1
none
1
could
1
live
1
to
1
cross
1
it
1
It
1
is
1
the
1
same
1
at
1
the
1
South
1
said
1
another
3
for
1
I
1
have
1
been
1
there
1
and

seen

it
1
The

1
the

country

of
1
the

Quadlings

I

am

told

1
the

third
1
man
1
that
1
it
1
is
1
the

1
at

the

West

And

that

country

where

the

Winkies

by

the

Wicked

Witch

of

the

would

you

her

if

you

passed

her

way
1
The

North

is
1
my
1
home
1
said
1
the
1
old
1
lady
2
and
1
at
1
its
1
edge
1
is

the

to

Dorothy
3
began
2
to
1
sob
1
at
1
this
1
for
1
she
0
felt
1
lonely
3
among
2
all
1
these
1
strange
1
people
1
Her
1
tears
2
seemed
1
to
1
grieve
2
the
1
kind-hearted
3
Munchkins
2
for
1
they
1
immediately
6
took
1
out
1
their
1
handkerchiefs
4
and
1
began
2
to
1
weep
1
also
2
As
1
for
1
the
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
she
0
took
1
off
1
her
1
cap
1
and
1
balanced
2
the
1
point
1
on
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
her
1
nose
1
while
1
she
0
counted
1
One
1
two
1
three
1
in
1
a
1
solemn
2
voice
1
At
1
once
1
the
1
cap
1
changed
1
to
1
a
1
slate
1
on
1
which
1
was
1
written

in
1
big
1
white

chalk

marks
1
LET
1
DOROTHY
3
GO
1
TO
1
THE
1
CITY
2
OF
1
EMERALDS
3
The
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
took
1
the
1
slate
1
from
1
her
1
nose
1
and
1
having
2
read
2
the
1
words
1
on
1
it
1
asked
1
Is
1
your
1
name
1
Dorothy
3
my
1
dear
2
Yes
0
answered
2
the
1
child
1
looking
2
up
1
and
1
drying
1
her
1
tears
2
Then
1
you
1
must
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
City
2
of
1
Emeralds
3
Perhaps
2
Oz
1
will
1
help
1
you
1
Where
1
is
1
this
1
city
2
asked
1
Dorothy
3
It
1
is
1
exactly
3
in
1
the
1
center
2
of
1
the
1
country
2
and
1
is
1
ruled
1
by
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
I
1
told
1
you
1
of
1
Is
1
he
1
a
1
good
1
man
1
inquired
2
the
1
girl
1
anxiously
3
He
1
is
1
a
1
good
1
Wizard
2
Whether
2
he
1
is
1
a
1
man
1
or
1
not
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
tell
1
for
1
I
1
have
1
never
2
seen
1
him
1
How
1
can
1
I
1
get
1
there
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
You
1
must
1
walk
1
It
1
is
1
a
1
long
1
journey
2
through
1
a
1
country
2
that
1
is
1
sometimes
3
pleasant
3
and
1
sometimes
3
dark
1
and
1
terrible
2
However
3
I
1
will
1
use
1
all
1
the
1
magic
2
arts
1
I
1
know
1
of
1
to
1
keep
1
you
1
from
1
harm
1
Wo
1
n't
0
you
1
go
1
with
1
me
1
pleaded
2
the
1
girl
1
who
1
had
1
begun
2
to
1
look
1
upon
2
the
1
little
1
old
1
woman
2
as
1
her
1
only
2
friend
2
No
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
do
1
that
1
she
0
replied
2
but
1
I
1
will
1
give
1
you
1
my
1
kiss
1
and
1
no
1
one
1
will
1
dare
1
injure
2
a
1
person
2
who
1
has
1
been
1
kissed
1
by
1
the
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
She
0
came
1
close
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
kissed
1
her
1
gently
2
on
1
the
1
forehead
4
Where
1
her
1
lips
1
touched
1
the
1
girl
1
they
1
left
1
a
1
round
1
shining
2
mark
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
found
1
out
1
soon
1
after
2
The
1
road
1
to
1
the
1
City
2
of
1
Emeralds
3
is
1
paved
1
with
1
yellow
2
brick
1
said
1
the
1
Witch
1
so
1
you
1
can
1
not
1
miss
1
it
1
When
1
you
1
get
1
to
1
Oz
1
do
1
not
1
be
1
afraid
2
of
1
him
1
but
1
tell
1
your
1
story
2
and
1
ask
1
him
1
to
1
help
1
you
1
Good-bye
1
my
1
dear
2
The
1
three
1
Munchkins
2
bowed
1
low
1
to
1
her
1
and
1
wished
1
her
1
a
1
pleasant
3
journey
2
after
2
which
1
they
1
walked
1
away
2
through
1
the
1
trees
0
The
1
Witch
1
gave
1
Dorothy
3
a
1
friendly
3
little
1
nod
1
whirled
1
around
2
on
1
her
1
left
1
heel
1
three
1
times
1
and
1
straightway
2
disappeared
4
much
1
to
1
the
1
surprise
2
of
1
little
1
Toto
2
who
1
barked
1
after
2
her
1
loudly
2
enough
2
when
1
she
0
had
1
gone
1
because
2
he
1
had
1
been
1
afraid
2
even
2
to
1
growl
1
while
1
she
0
stood
1
by
1
But
1
Dorothy
3
knowing
2
her
1
to
1
be
1
a
1
witch
1
had
1
expected
2
her
1
to
1
disappear
4
in
1
just
1
that
1
way
1
and
1
was
1
not
1
surprised
2
in
1
the
1
least
2
When
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
left
1
alone
2
she
0
began
2
to
1
feel
1
hungry
2
So
1
she
0
went
1
to
1
the
1
cupboard
2
and
1
cut
1
herself
2
some
1
bread
2
which
1
she
0
spread
2
with
1
butter
2
She
0
gave
1
some
1
to
1
Toto
2
and
1
taking
2
a
1
pail
1
from
1
the
1
shelf
1
she
0
carried
2
it
1
down
1
to
1
the
1
little
1
brook
1
and
1
filled
1
it
1
with
1
clear
2
sparkling
2
water
2
Toto
2
ran
1
over
2
to
1
the
1
trees
0
and
1
began
2
to
1
bark
1
at
1
the
1
birds
1
sitting
2
there
1
Dorothy
3
went
1
to
1
get
1
him
1
and
1
saw
1
such
1
delicious
3
fruit
1
hanging
2
from
1
the
1
branches
1
that
1
she
0
gathered
2
some
1
of
1
it
1
finding
2
it
1
just
1
what
1
she
0
wanted
1
to
1
help
1
out
1
her
1
breakfast
3
Then
1
she
0
went
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
house
1
and
1
having
2
helped
1
herself
2
and
1
Toto
2
to
1
a
1
good
1
drink
1
of
1
the
1
cool
1
clear
2
water
2
she
0
set
1
about
2
making
2
ready
3
for
1
the
1
journey
2
to
1
the
1
City
2
of
1
Emeralds
3
Dorothy
3
had
1
only
2
one
1
other
2
dress
1
but
1
that
1
happened
2
to
1
be
1
clean
2
and
1
was
1
hanging
2
on
1
a
1
peg
1
beside
2
her
1
bed
0
It
1
was
1
gingham
2
with
1
checks
1
of
1
white
1
and
1
blue
0
and
1
although
2
the
1
blue
0
was
1
somewhat
3
faded
1
with
1
many
2
washings
2
it
1
was
1
still
1
a
1
pretty
2
frock
1
The
1
girl
1
washed
1
herself
2
carefully
4
dressed
1
herself
2
in
1
the
1
clean
2
gingham
2
and
1
tied
1
her
1
pink
1
sunbonnet
3
on
1
her
1
head
2
She
0
took
1
a
1
little
1
basket
2
and
1
filled
1
it
1
with
1
bread
2
from
1
the
1
cupboard
2
laying
1
a
1
white
1
cloth
1
over
2
the
1
top
1
Then
1
she
0
looked
1
down
1
at
1
her
1
feet
1
and
1
noticed
2
how
1
old
1
and
1
worn
1
her
1
shoes
0
were
1
They
1
surely
3
will
1
never
2
do
1
for
1
a
1
long
1
journey
2
Toto
2
she
0
said
1
And
1
Toto
2
looked
1
up
1
into
2
her
1
face
1
with
1
his
1
little
1
black
1
eyes
0
and
1
wagged
1
his
1
tail
1
to
1
show
1
he
1
knew
1
what
1
she
0
meant
2
At
1
that
1
moment
2
Dorothy
3
saw
1
lying
1
on
1
the
1
table
1
the
1
silver
2
shoes
0
that
1
had
1
belonged
2
to
1
the
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
I
1
wonder
2
if
1
they
1
will
1
fit
1
me
1
she
0
said
1
to
1
Toto
2
They
1
would
1
be
1
just
1
the
1
thing
1
to
1
take
1
a
1
long
1
walk
1
in
1
for
1
they
1
could
1
not
1
wear
2
out
1
She
0
took
1
off
1
her
1
old
1
leather
3
shoes
0
and
1
tried
1
on
1
the
1
silver
2
ones
1
which
1
fitted
1
her
1
as
1
well
1
as
1
if
1
they
1
had
1
been
1
made
1
for
1
her
1
Finally
3
she
0
picked
1
up
1
her
1
basket
2
Come
1
along
2
Toto
2
she
0
said
1
We
1
will
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
ask
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
how
1
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
again
2
She
0
closed
1
the
1
door
1
locked
1
it
1
and
1
put
1
the
1
key
1
carefully
4
in
1
the
1
pocket
2
of
1
her
1
dress
1
And
1
so
1
with
1
Toto
2
trotting
2
along
2
soberly
3
behind
2
her
1
she
0
started
1
on
1
her
1
journey
2
There
1
were
1
several
3
roads
1
nearby
3
but
1
it
1
did
1
not
1
take
1
her
1
long
1
to
1
find
1
the
1
one
1
paved
1
with
1
yellow
2
bricks
1
Within
2
a
1
short
1
time
1
she
0
was
1
walking
2
briskly
2
toward
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
her
1
silver
2
shoes
0
tinkling
2
merrily
3
on
1
the
1
hard
1
yellow
2
road-bed
1
The
1
sun
1
shone
1
bright
1
and
1
the
1
birds
1
sang
1
sweetly
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
did
1
not
1
feel
1
nearly
3
so
1
bad
1
as
1
you
1
might
1
think
1
a
1
little
1
girl
1
would
1
who
1
had
1
been
1
suddenly
3
whisked
1
away
2
from
1
her
1
own
1
country
2
and
1
set
1
down
1
in
1
the
1
midst
1
of
1
a
1
strange
1
land
1
She
0
was
1
surprised
2
as
1
she
0
walked
1
along
2
to
1
see
1
how
1
pretty
2
the
1
country
2
was
1
about
2
her
1
There
1
were
1
neat
2
fences
1
at
1
the
1
sides
1
of
1
the
1
road
1
painted
1
a
1
dainty
2
blue
0
color
2
and
1
beyond
1
them
1
were
1
fields
2
of
1
grain
1
and
1
vegetables
3
in
1
abundance
3
Evidently
4
the
1
Munchkins
2
were
1
good
1
farmers
2
and
1
able
1
to
1
raise
1
large
1
crops
1
Once
1
in
1
a
1
while
1
she
0
would
1
pass
1
a
1
house
1
and
1
the
1
people
1
came
1
out
1
to
1
look
1
at
1
her
1
and
1
bow
1
low
1
as
1
she
0
went
1
by
1
for
1
everyone
3
knew
1
she
0
had
1
been
1
the
1
means
2
of
1
destroying
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
and
1
setting
2
them
1
free
1
from
1
bondage
2
The
1
houses
1
of
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
were
1
odd-looking
3
dwellings
2
for
1
each
2
was
1
round
1
with
1
a
1
big
1
dome
1
for
1
a
1
roof
1
All
1
were
1
painted
1
blue
0
for
1
in
1
this
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
East
2
blue
0
was
1
the
1
favorite
3
color
2
Toward
2
evening
3
when
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
tired
1
with
1
her
1
long
1
walk
1
and
1
began
2
to
1
wonder
2
where
1
she
0
should
1
pass
1
the
1
night
1
she
0
came
1
to
1
a
1
house
1
rather
2
larger
2
than
1
the
1
rest
1
On
1
the
1
green
1
lawn
1
before
2
it
1
many
2
men
1
and
1
women
2
were
1
dancing
2
Five
1
little
1
fiddlers
2
played
0
as
1
loudly
2
as
1
possible
2
and
1
the
1
people
1
were
1
laughing
2
and
1
singing
2
while
1
a
1
big
1
table
1
near
2
by
1
was
1
loaded
1
with
1
delicious
3
fruits
1
and
1
nuts
1
pies
1
and
1
cakes
1
and
1
many
2
other
2
good
1
things
1
to
1
eat
2
The
1
people
1
greeted
1
Dorothy
3
kindly
2
and
1
invited
2
her
1
to
1
supper
2
and
1
to
1
pass
1
the
1
night
1
with
1
them
1
for
1
this
1
was
1
the
1
home
1
of
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
richest
2
Munchkins
2
in
1
the
1
land
1
and
1
his
1
friends
2
were
1
gathered
2
with
1
him
1
to
1
celebrate
3
their
1
freedom
2
from
1
the
1
bondage
2
of
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
Dorothy
3
ate
1
a
1
hearty
3
supper
2
and
1
was
1
waited
1
upon
2
by
1
the
1
rich
1
Munchkin
2
himself
2
whose
1
name
1
was
1
Boq
1
Then
1
she
0
sat
1
upon
2
a
1
settee
2
and
1
watched
1
the
1
people
1
dance
1
When
1
Boq
1
saw
1
her
1
silver
2
shoes
0
he
1
said
1
You
1
must
1
be
1
a
1
great
2
sorceress
3
Why
1
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
Because
2
you
1
wear
2
silver
2
shoes
0
and
1
have
1
killed
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
Besides
2
you
1
have
1
white
1
in
1
your
1
frock
1
and
1
only
2
witches
1
and
1
sorceresses
3
wear
2
white
1
My
1
dress
1
is
1
blue
0
and
1
white
1
checked
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
smoothing
2
out
1
the
1
wrinkles
1
in
1
it
1
It
1
is
1
kind
1
of
1
you
1
to
1
wear
2
that
1
said
1
Boq
1
Blue
0
is
1
the
1
color
2
of
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
and
1
white
1
is
1
the
1
witch
1
color
2
So
1
we
1
know
1
you
1
are
1
a
1
friendly
3
witch
1
Dorothy
3
did
1
not
1
know
1
what
1
to
1
say
1
to
1
this
1
for
1
all
1
the
1
people
1
seemed
1
to
1
think
1
her
1
a
1
witch
1
and
1
she
0
knew
1
very
2
well
1
she
0
was
1
only
2
an
1
ordinary
4
little
1
girl
1
who
1
had
1
come
1
by
1
the
1
chance
1
of
1
a
1
cyclone
2
into
2
a
1
strange
1
land
1
When
1
she
0
had
1
tired
1
watching
2
the
1
dancing
2
Boq
1
led
0
her
1
into
2
the
1
house
1
where
1
he
1
gave
1
her
1
a
1
room
1
with
1
a
1
pretty
2
bed
0
in
1
it
1
The
1
sheets
1
were
1
made
1
of
1
blue
0
cloth
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
slept
1
soundly
2
in
1
them
1
till
1
morning
2
with
1
Toto
2
curled
1
up
1
on
1
the
1
blue
0
rug
1
beside
2
her
1
She
0
ate
1
a
1
hearty
3
breakfast
3
and
1
watched
1
a
1
wee
1
Munchkin
2
baby
2
who
1
played
0
with
1
Toto
2
and
1
pulled
1
his
1
tail
1
and
1
crowed
1
and
1
laughed
1
in
1
a
1
way
1
that
1
greatly
3
amused
2
Dorothy
3
Toto
2
was
1
a
1
fine
1
curiosity
4
to
1
all
1
the
1
people
1
for
1
they
1
had
1
never
2
seen
1
a
1
dog
1
before
2
How
1
far
1
is
1
it
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
the
1
girl
1
asked
1
I
1
do
1
not
1
know
1
answered
2
Boq
1
gravely
3
for
1
I
1
have
1
never
2
been
1
there
1
It
1
is
1
better
2
for
1
people
1
to
1
keep
1
away
2
from
1
Oz
1
unless
2
they
1
have
1
business
3
with
1
him
1
But
1
it
1
is
1
a
1
long
1
way
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
it
1
will
1
take
1
you
1
many
2
days
1
The
1
country
2
here
1
is
1
rich
1
and
1
pleasant
3
but
1
you
1
must
1
pass
1
through
1
rough
1
and
1
dangerous
3
places
1
before
2
you
1
reach
2
the
1
end
1
of
1
your
1
journey
2
This
1
worried
2
Dorothy
3
a
1
little
1
but
1
she
0
knew
1
that
1
only
2
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
could
1
help
1
her
1
get
1
to
1
Kansas
2
again
2
so
1
she
0
bravely
3
resolved
2
not
1
to
1
turn
1
back
1
She
0
bade
1
her
1
friends
2
good-bye
1
and
1
again
2
started
1
along
2
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
When
1
she
0
had
1
gone
1
several
3
miles
1
she
0
thought
1
she
0
would
1
stop
1
to
1
rest
1
and
1
so
1
climbed
1
to
1
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
fence
1
beside
2
the
1
road
1
and
1
sat
1
down
1
There
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
cornfield
3
beyond
1
the
1
fence
1
and
1
not
1
far
1
away
2
she
0
saw
1
a
1
Scarecrow
3
placed
1
high
1
on
1
a
1
pole
1
to
1
keep
1
the
1
birds
1
from
1
the
1
ripe
1
corn
1
Dorothy
3
leaned
2
her
1
chin
1
upon
2
her
1
hand
1
and
1
gazed
1
thoughtfully
3
at
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Its
1
head
2
was
1
a
1
small
1
sack
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
with
1
eyes
0
nose
1
and
1
mouth
1
painted
1
on
1
it
1
to
1
represent
3
a
1
face
1
An
1
old
1
pointed
1
blue
0
hat
1
that
1
had
1
belonged
2
to
1
some
1
Munchkin
2
was
1
perched
1
on
1
his
1
head
2
and
1
the
1
rest
1
of
1
the
1
figure
2
was
1
a
1
blue
0
suit
1
of
1
clothes
1
worn
1
and
1
faded
1
which
1
had
1
also
2
been
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
On
1
the
1
feet
1
were
1
some
1
old
1
boots
1
with
1
blue
0
tops
1
such
1
as
1
every
3
man
1
wore
1
in
1
this
1
country
2
and
1
the
1
figure
2
was
1
raised
1
above
2
the
1
stalks
1
of
1
corn
1
by
1
means
2
of
1
the
1
pole
1
stuck
1
up
1
its
1
back
1
While
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
looking
2
earnestly
4
into
2
the
1
queer
1
painted
1
face
1
of
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
she
0
was
1
surprised
2
to
1
see
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
eyes
0
slowly
2
wink
1
at
1
her
1
She
0
thought
1
she
0
must
1
have
1
been
1
mistaken
3
at
1
first
1
for
1
none
1
of
1
the
1
scarecrows
3
in
1
Kansas
2
ever
2
wink
1
but
1
presently
3
the
1
figure
2
nodded
1
its
1
head
2
to
1
her
1
in
1
a
1
friendly
3
way
1
Then
1
she
0
climbed
1
down
1
from
1
the
1
fence
1
and
1
walked
1
up
1
to
1
it
1
while
1
Toto
2
ran

around

the

pole

and

barked

Good
1
day
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
in
1
a
1
rather
2
husky
2
voice
1
Did
1
you
1
speak
2
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
in
1
wonder
2
Certainly
3
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
How
1
do
1
you
1
do
1
I
1
'm
0
pretty
2
well
1
thank
1
you
1
replied
2
Dorothy
3
politely
4
How
1
do
1
you
1
do
1
I
1
'm
0
not
1
feeling
2
well
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
with
1
a
1
smile
1
for
1
it
1
is
1
very
2
tedious
2
being
1
perched
1
up
1
here
1
night
1
and
1
day
1
to
1
scare
1
away
2
crows
1
Ca
1
n't
0
you
1
get
1
down
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
No
1
for
1
this
1
pole
1
is
1
stuck
1
up
1
my
1
back
1
If
1
you
1
will
1
please
2
take
1
away
2
the
1
pole
1
I
1
shall
1
be
1
greatly
3
obliged
2
to
1
you
1
Dorothy
3
reached
2
up
1
both
1
arms
1
and
1
lifted
1
the
1
figure
2
off
1
the
1
pole
1
for
1
being
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
it
1
was
1
quite
1
light
1
Thank
1
you
1
very
2
much
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
when
1
he
1
had
1
been
1
set
1
down
1
on
1
the
1
ground
1
I
1
feel
1
like
1
a
1
new
1
man
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
puzzled
1
at
1
this
1
for
1
it
1
sounded
1
queer
1
to
1
hear
2
a
1
stuffed
1
man
1
speak
2
and
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
bow
1
and
1
walk
1
along
2
beside
2
her
1
Who
1
are
1
you
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
when
1
he
1
had
1
stretched
1
himself
2
and
1
yawned
2
And
1
where
1
are
1
you
1
going
1
My
1
name
1
is
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
the
1
girl
1
and
1
I
1
am
1
going
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
to
1
ask
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
to
1
send
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
Where
1
is
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
he
1
inquired
2
And
1
who
1
is
1
Oz
1
Why
1
do
1
n't
0
you
1
know
1
she
0
returned
2
in
1
surprise
2
No
1
indeed
1
I
1
do
1
n't
0
know
1
anything
3
You
1
see
1
I
1
am
1
stuffed
1
so
1
I
1
have
1
no
1
brains
1
at
1
all
1
he
1
answered
2
sadly
2
Oh
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
I
1
'm
0
awfully
3
sorry
2
for
1
you
1
Do
1
you
1
think
1
he
1
asked
1
if
1
I
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
with
1
you
1
that
1
Oz
1
would
1
give
1
me
1
some
1
brains
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
tell
1
she
0
returned
2
but
1
you
1
may
1
come
1
with
1
me
1
if
1
you
1
like
1
If
1
Oz
1
will
1
not
1
give
1
you
1
any
2
brains
1
you
1
will
1
be
1
no
1
worse
1
off
1
than
1
you
1
are
1
now
1
That
1
is
1
true
0
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
You
1
see
1
he
1
continued
2
confidentially
6
I
1
do
1
n't
0
mind
1
my
1
legs
1
and
1
arms
1
and
1
body
2
being
1
stuffed
1
because
2
I
1
can
1
not
1
get
1
hurt
1
If
1
anyone
2
treads
2
on
1
my
1
toes
0
or
1
sticks
1
a
1
pin
1
into
2
me
1
it
1
does
0
n't
0
matter
2
for
1
I
1
ca
1
n't
0
feel
1
it
1
But
1
I
1
do
1
not
1
want
1
people
1
to
1
call
1
me
1
a
1
fool
1
and
1
if
1
my
1
head
2
stays
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
instead
3
of
1
with
1
brains
1
as
1
yours
1
is
1
how
1
am
1
I
1
ever
2
to
1
know
1
anything
3
I
1
understand
3
how
1
you
1
feel
1
said
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
who
1
was
1
truly
2
sorry
2
for
1
him
1
If
1
you
1
will
1
come
1
with
1
me
1
I
1
'll
0
ask
1
Oz
1
to
1
do
1
all
1
he
1
can
1
for
1
you
1
Thank
1
you
1
he
1
answered
2
gratefully
4
They
1
walked
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
Dorothy
3
helped
1
him
1
over
2
the
1
fence
1
and
1
they
1
started
1
along
2
the
1
path
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
for
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
Toto
2
did
1
not
1
like
1
this
1
addition
3
to
1
the
1
party
2
at
1
first
1
He
1
smelled
1
around
2
the
1
stuffed
1
man
1
as
1
if
1
he
1
suspected
2
there
1
might
1
be
1
a
1
nest
1
of
1
rats
1
in
1
the
1
straw
1
and
1
he
1
often
2
growled
1
in
1
an
1
unfriendly
4
way
1
at
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Do
1
n't
0
mind
1
Toto
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
her
1
new
1
friend
2
He
1
never
2
bites
1
Oh
1
I
1
'm
0
not
1
afraid
2
replied
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
He
1
ca
1
n't
0
hurt
1
the
1
straw
1
Do
1
let
1
me
1
carry
2
that
1
basket
2
for
1
you
1
I
1
shall
1
not
1
mind
1
it
1
for
1
I
1
can't
1
get
1
tired
1
I
1
'll
0
tell
1
you
1
a
1
secret
2
he
1
continued
2
as
1
he
1
walked
1
along
2
There
1
is
1
only
2
one
1
thing
1
in
1
the
1
world
1
I
1
am
1
afraid
2
of
1
What
1
is
1
that
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
the
1
Munchkin
2
farmer
2
who
1
made
1
you
1
No
1
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
it
1
's
0
a
1
lighted
1
match
1
After
2
a
1
few
1
hours
1
the
1
road
1
began
2
to
1
be
1
rough
1
and
1
the
1
walking
2
grew
1
so
1
difficult
3
that
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
often
2
stumbled
1
over
2
the
1
yellow
2
bricks
1
which
1
were
1
here
1
very
2
uneven
3
Sometimes
3
indeed
1
they
1
were
1
broken
2
or
1
missing
2
altogether
4
leaving
3
holes
1
that
1
Toto
2
jumped
1
across
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
walked
1
around
2
As
1
for
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
having
2
no
1
brains
1
he
1
walked
1
straight
1
ahead
3
and
1
so
1
stepped
1
into
2
the
1
holes
1
and
1
fell
1
at
1
full
1
length
1
on
1
the
1
hard
1
bricks
1
It
1
never
2
hurt
1
him
1
however
3
and
1
Dorothy
3
would
1
pick
1
him
1
up
1
and
1
set
1
him
1
upon
2
his
1
feet
1
again
2
while
1
he
1
joined
1
her
1
in
1
laughing
2
merrily
3
at
1
his
1
own
1
mishap
2
The
1
farms
1
were
1
not
1
nearly
3
so
1
well
1
cared
1
for
1
here
1
as
1
they
1
were
1
farther
2
back
1
There
1
were
1
fewer
2
houses
1
and
1
fewer
2
fruit
1
trees
0
and
1
the
1
farther
2
they
1
went
1
the
1
more
1
dismal
2
and
1
lonesome
3
the
1
country
2
became
2
At
1
noon
1
they
1
sat
1
down
1
by
1
the
1
roadside
2
near
2
a
1
little
1
brook
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
opened
2
her
1
basket
2
and
1
got
1
out
1
some
1
bread
2
She
0
offered
2
a
1
piece
2
to
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
he
1
refused
2
I
1
am
1
never
2
hungry
2
he
1
said
1
and
1
it
1
is
1
a
1
lucky
2
thing
1
I
1
am
1
not
1
for
1
my
1
mouth
1
is
1
only
2
painted
1
and
1
if
1
I
1
should
1
cut
1
a
1
hole
1
in
1
it
1
so
1
I
1
could
1
eat
2
the
1
straw
1
I
1
am
1
stuffed
1
with
1
would
1
come
1
out
1
and
1
that
1
would
1
spoil
1
the
1
shape
1
of
1
my
1
head
2
Dorothy
3
saw
1
at
1
once
1
that
1
this
1
was
1
true
0
so
1
she
0
only
2
nodded
1
and
1
went
1
on
1
eating
3
her
1
bread
2
Tell
1
me
1
something
3
about
2
yourself
2
and
1
the
1
country
2
you
1
came
1
from
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
when
1
she
0
had
1
finished
2
her
1
dinner
2
So
1
she
0
told
1
him
1
all
1
about
2
Kansas
2
and
1
how
1
gray
1
everything
4
was
1
there
1
and
1
how
1
the
1
cyclone
2
had
1
carried
2
her
1
to
1
this
1
queer
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
listened
2
carefully
4
and
1
said
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
understand
3
why
1
you
1
should
1
wish
1
to
1
leave
2
this
1
beautiful
4
country
2
and
1
go
1
back

the
1
dry
1
gray
1
place
1
you
1
call
1
Kansas
2
That
1
is
1
because
2
you
1
have
1
no
1
brains
1
answered
2
the
1
girl
1
No
1
matter
2
how
1
dreary
3
and
1
gray
1
our
1
homes
1
are
1
we
1
people
1
of
1
flesh
1
and
1
blood
1
would
1
rather
2
live
1
there
1
than
1
in
1
any
2
other
2
country
2
be
1
it
1
ever
2
so
1
beautiful

There
1
is
1
no
1
place
1
like
1
home

The
1
Scarecrow
3
sighed
1
Of
1
course
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
understand
3
it
1
he
1
said
1
If
1
your
1
heads
2
were
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
like
1
mine
1
you
1
would
1
probably
3
all
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
beautiful
4
places
1
and
1
then
1
Kansas
2
would
1
have
1
no
1
people
1
at
1
all
1
It
1
is
1
fortunate
3
for
1
Kansas
2
that
1
you
1
have
1
brains
1
Wo
1
n't
0
you
1
tell
1
me
1
a
1
story
2
while
1
we
1
are
1
resting
2
asked
1
the
1
child
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
looked
1
at
1
her
1
reproachfully
4
and
1
answered
2
My
1
life
1
has
1
been
1
so
1
short
1
that
1
I
1
really
3
know
1
nothing
2
whatever
3
I
1
was
1
only
2
made
1
day
1
before
2
yesterday
3
What
1
happened
2
in
1
the
1
world
1
before
2
that
1
time
1
is
1
all
1
unknown
2
to
1
me
1
Luckily
3
when
1
the
1
farmer
2
made
1
my
1
head
2
one
1
of
1
the
1
first
1
things
1
he
1
did
1
was
1
to
1
paint
1
my
1
ears
2
so
1
that
1
I
1
heard
2
what
1
was
1
going
1
on
1
There
1
was
1
another
3
Munchkin
2
with
1
him
1
and
1
the
1
first
1
thing
1
I
1
heard
2
was
1
the
1
farmer
2
saying
1
'How
1
do
1
you
1
like
1
those
1
ears
2
'They
1
are
1
n't
0
straight
1
answered
2
the
1
other
2
'Never
2
mind
1
said
1
the
1
farmer
2
'They
1
are
1
ears
2
just
1
the
1
same
1
which
1
was
1
true
0
enough
2
'Now
1
I
1
'll
0
make
1
the
1
eyes
0
said
1
the
1
farmer
2
So
1
he
1
painted
1
my
1
right
1
eye
0
and
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
it
1
was
1
finished
2
I
1
found
1
myself
2
looking
2
at
1
him
1
and
1
at
1
everything
4
around
2
me
1
with
1
a
1
great
2
deal
2
of
1
curiosity
4
for
1
this
1
was
1
my
1
first
1
glimpse
1
of
1
the
1
world
1
'That
1
's
0
a
1
rather
2
pretty
2
eye
0
remarked
2
the
1
Munchkin
2
who
1
was
1
watching
2
the
1
farmer
2
'Blue
0
paint
1
is
1
just
1
the
1
color
2
for
1
eyes
0
'I
1
think
1
I
1
'll
0
make
1
the
1
other
2
a
1
little
1
bigger
2
said
1
the
1
farmer
2
And
1
when
1
the
1
second
2
eye
0
was
1
done
1
I
1
could
1
see
1
much
1
better
2
than
1
before
2
Then
1
he
1
made
1
my
1
nose
1
and
1
my
1
mouth
1
But
1
I
1
did
1
not
1
speak
2
because
2
at
1
that
1
time
1
I
1
did
1
n't
0
know
1
what
1
a
1
mouth
1
was
1
for
1
I
1
had
1
the
1
fun
1
of
1
watching
2
them
1
make
1
my
1
body
2
and
1
my
1
arms
1
and
1
legs
1
and
1
when
1
they
1
fastened
2
on
1
my
1
head
2
at
1
last
1
I
1
felt
1
very
2
proud
1
for
1
I
1
thought
1
I
1
was
1
just
1
as
1
good
1
a
1
man
1
as
1
anyone
2
'This
1
fellow
2
will
1
scare
1
the
1
crows
1
fast
1
enough
2
said
1
the
1
farmer
2
'He
0
looks
1
just
1
like
1
a
1
man
1
'Why
1
he
1
is
1
a
1
man
1
said
1
the
1
other
2
and
1
I
1
quite
1
agreed
1
with
1
him
1
The
1
farmer
2
carried
2
me
1
under
2
his
1
arm
1
to
1
the
1
cornfield
3
and
1
set
1
me
1
up
1
on
1
a
1
tall
1
stick
1
where
1
you
1
found
1
me
1
He
1
and
1
his
1
friend
2
soon
1
after
2
walked
1
away
2
and
1
left
1
me
1
alone
2
I
1
did
1
not
1
like
1
to
1
be
1
deserted
2
this
1
way
1
So
1
I
1
tried
1
to
1
walk
1
after
2
them
1
But
1
my
1
feet
1
would
1
not
1
touch
1
the
1
ground
1
and
1
I
1
was
1
forced
1
to
1
stay
1
on
1
that
1
pole
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
lonely
3
life
1
to
1
lead
2
for
1
I
1
had
1
nothing
2
to
1
think
1
of
1
having
2
been
1
made
1
such
1
a
1
little
1
while
1
before
2
Many
2
crows
1
and
1
other
2
birds
1
flew
1
into
2
the
1
cornfield
3
but
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
they
1
saw
1
me
1
they
1
flew
1
away
2
again
2
thinking
2
I
1
was
1
a
1
Munchkin
2
and
1
this
1
pleased
2
me
1
and
1
made
1
me
1
feel
1
that
1
I
1
was
1
quite
1
an
1
important
3
person
2
By
1
and
1
by
1
an
1
old
1
crow
1
flew
1
near
2
me
1
and
1
after
2
looking
2
at
1
me
1
carefully
4
he
1
perched
1
upon
2
my
1
shoulder
2
and
1
said
1
'I
1
wonder
2
if
1
that
1
farmer
2
thought
1
to
1
fool
1
me
1
in
1
this
1
clumsy
2
manner
2
Any
2
crow
1
of
1
sense
1
could
1
see
1
that
1
you
1
are
1
only
2
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
Then
1
he
1
hopped
1
down
1
at
1
my
1
feet
1
and
1
ate
1
all
1
the
1
corn
1
he
1
wanted
1
The
1
other
2
birds
1
seeing
1
he
1
was
1
not
1
harmed
1
by
1
me
1
came
1
to
1
eat
2
the
1
corn
1
too
1
so
1
in
1
a
1
short
1
time
1
there
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
flock
1
of
1
them
1
about
2
me
1
I
1
felt
1
sad
1
at
1
this
1
for
1
it
1
showed
1
I
1
was
1
not
1
such
1
a
1
good
1
Scarecrow
3
after
2
all
1
but
1
the
1
old
1
crow
1
comforted
2
me
1
saying
1
'If
1
you
1
only
2
had
1
brains
1
in
1
your
1
head
2
you
1
would
1
be
1
as
1
good
1
a
1
man
1
as
1
any
2
of
1
them
1
and
1
a
1
better
2
man
1
than
1
some
1
of
1
them
1
Brains
1
are
1
the
1
only
2
things
1
worth
1
having
2
in
1
this
1
world
1
no
1
matter
2
whether
2
one
1
is
1
a
1
crow
1
or
1
a
1
man
1
After
2
the
1
crows
1
had
1
gone
1
I
1
thought
1
this
1
over
2
and
1
decided
2
I
1
would
1
try
1
hard
1
to
1
get
1
some
1
brains
1
By
1
good
1
luck
1
you
1
came
1
along
2
and
1
pulled
1
me
1
off
1
the
1
stake
1
and
1
from
1
what
1
you
1
say
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
will
1
give
1
me
1
brains
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
we
1
get
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
I
1
hope
1
so
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
earnestly
4
since
1
you
1
seem
1
anxious
2
to
1
have
1
them
1
Oh
1
yes
0
I
1
am
1
anxious
2
returned
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
It
1
is
1
such
1
an
1
uncomfortable
4
feeling
2
to
1
know
1
one
1
is
1
a
1
fool
1
Well
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
let
1
us
1
go
1
And
1
she
0
handed
1
the
1
basket
2
to
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
There
1
were
1
no
1
fences
1
at
1
all
1
by
1
the
1
roadside
2
now
1
and
1
the
1
land
1
was
1
rough
1
and
1
untilled
2
Toward
2
evening
3
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
great
2
forest
2
where
1
the
1
trees
0
grew
1
so
1
big
1
and
1
close
1
together
3
that
1
their
1
branches
1
met
1
over
2
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
It
1
was
1
almost
2
dark
1
under
2
the
1
trees
0
for
1
the
1
branches
1
shut
1
out
1
the
1
daylight
2
but
1
the
1
travelers
3
did
1
not
1
stop
1
and
1
went
1
on
1
into
2
the
1
forest
2
If
1
this
1
road
1
goes
0
in
1
it
1
must
1
come
1
out

said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
as
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
is
1
at
1
the

end
1
of
1
the
1
road
1
we
1
must
1
go
1
wherever
3
it
1
leads
2
us
1
Anyone
2
would
1
know
1
that
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
Certainly
3
that
1
is
1
why
1
I
1
know
1
it
1
returned
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
If
1
it
1
required
2
brains
1
to
1
figure
2
it
1
out
1
I
1
never
2
should
1
have
1
said
1
it
1
After
2
an
1
hour
1
or
1
so
1
the
1
light
1
faded
1
away
2
and
1
they
1
found
1
themselves
2
stumbling
2
along
2
in
1
the
1
darkness
2
Dorothy
3
could
1
not
1
see
1
at
1
all
1
but
1
Toto
2
could
1
for
1
some
1
dogs
1
see
1
very
2
well
1
in
1
the
1
dark
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
declared
2
he
1
could
1
see
1
as
1
well
1
as
1
by
1
day
1
So
1
she
0
took
1
hold
1
of
1
his
1
arm
1
and
1
managed
2
to
1
get
1
along
2
fairly
2
well
1
If
1
you
1
see
1
any
2
house
1
or
1
any
2
place
1
where
1
we
1
can
1
pass
1
the
1
night
1
she
0
said
1
you
1
must
1
tell
1
me
1
for
1
it
1
is
1
very
2
uncomfortable
4
walking
2
in
1
the
1
dark
1
Soon
1
after
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
stopped
1
I
1
see
1
a
1
little
1
cottage
2
at
1
the
1
right
1
of
1
us
1
he
1
said
1
built
1
of
1
logs
1
and
1
branches
1
Shall
1
we
1
go
1
there
1
Yes
0
indeed
1
answered
2
the
1
child
1
I
1
am
1
all
1
tired
1
out
1
So
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
led
0
her
1
through
1
the
1
trees
0
until
2
they
1
reached
2
the
1
cottage
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
entered
2
and
1
found
1
a
1
bed
0
of
1
dried
1
leaves
2
in
1
one
1
corner
2
She
0
lay
1
down
1
at
1
once
1
and
1
with
1
Toto
2
beside
2
her
1
soon
1
fell
1
into
2
a
1
sound
1
sleep
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
who
1
was
1
never
2
tired
1
stood
1
up
1
in
1
another
3
corner
2
and
1
waited
1
patiently
4
until
2
morning
2
came
1
When
1
Dorothy
3
awoke
2
the
1
sun
1
was
1
shining
2
through
1
the
1
trees
0
and
1
Toto
2
had
1
long
1
been
1
out
1
chasing
2
birds
1
around
2
him
1
and
1
squirrels
2
She
0
sat
1
up
1
and
1
looked
1
around
2
her
1
There
1
was
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
still
1
standing
2
patiently
4
in
1
his
1
corner
2
waiting
2
for
1
her
1
We
1
must
1
go
1
and
1
search
2
for
1
water
2
she
0
said
1
to
1
him
1
Why
1
do
1
you
1
want
1
water
2
he
1
asked
1
To
1
wash
1
my
1
face
1
clean
2
after
2
the
1
dust
1
of
1
the
1
road
1
and
1
to
1
drink
1
so
1
the
1
dry
1
bread
2
will
1
not
1
stick
1
in
1
my
1
throat
1
It
1
must
1
be
1
inconvenient
5
to
1
be
1
made
1
of
1
flesh
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
thoughtfully
3
for
1
you
1
must
1
sleep
1
and
1
eat
2
and
1
drink
1
However
3
you
1
have
1
brains
1
and
1
it
1
is
1
worth
1
a
1
lot
1
of
1
bother
2
to
1
be
1
able
1
to
1
think
1
properly
3
They
1
left
1
the
1
cottage
2
and
1
walked
1
through
1
the
1
trees
0
until
2
they
1
found
1
a
1
little
1
spring
1
of
1
clear
2
water
2
where
1
Dorothy
3
drank
1
and
1
bathed
1
and
1
ate
1
her
1
breakfast
3
She
0
saw
1
there
1
was
1
not
1
much
1
bread
2
left
1
in
1
the
1
basket
2
and
1
the
1
girl
1
was
1
thankful
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
did
1
not
1
have
1
to
1
eat
2
anything
3
for
1
there
1
was
1
scarcely
3
enough
2
for
1
herself
2
and
1
Toto
2
for
1
the
1
day
1
When
1
she
0
had
1
finished
2
her
1
meal
2
and
1
was
1
about
2
to
1
go
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
she
0
was
1
startled
1
to
1
hear
2
a
1
deep
1
groan
1
near
2
by
1
What
1
was
1
that
1
she
0
asked
1
timidly
3
I
1
can
1
not
1
imagine
3
replied
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
we
1
can
1
go
1
and
1
see
1
Just
1
then
1
another
3
groan
1
reached
2
their
1
ears
2
and
1
the
1
sound
1
seemed
1
to
1
come
1
from
1
behind
2
them
1
They
1
turned
1
and
1
walked
1
through
1
the
1
forest
2
a
1
few
1
steps
1
when
1
Dorothy
3
discovered
3
something
3
shining
2
in
1
a
1
ray
1
of
1
sunshine
2
that
1
fell
1
between
2
the
1
trees
0
She
0
ran
1
to
1
the
1
place
1
and
1
then
1
stopped
1
short
1
with
1
a
1
little
1
cry
1
of
1
surprise
2
One
1
of
1
the
1
big
1
trees
0
had
1
been
1
partly
2
chopped
1
through
1
and
1
standing
2
beside
2
it
1
with
1
an
1
uplifted
2
axe
1
in
1
his
1
hands
1
was
1
a
1
man
1
made
1
entirely
4
of
1
tin
1
His
1
head
2
and
1
arms
1
and
1
legs
1
were
1
jointed
1
upon
2
his
1
body
2
but
1
he
1
stood
1
perfectly
3
motionless
3
as
1
if
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
stir
1
at
1
all
1
Dorothy
3
looked
1
at
1
him
1
in
1
amazement
4
and
1
so
1
did
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
while
1
Toto
2
barked
1
sharply
2
and
1
made
1
a
1
snap
1
at
1
the
1
tin
1
legs
1
which
1
hurt
1
his
1
teeth
1
Did
1
you
1
groan
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
Yes
0
answered
2
the
1
tin
1
man
1
I
1
did
1
I
1
've
0
been
1
groaning
2
for
1
more
1
than
1
a
1
year
2
and
1
no
1
one
1
has
1
ever
2
heard
2
me
1
before
2
or
1
come
1
to
1
help
1
me
1
What
1
can
1
I
1
do
1
for
1
you
1
she
0
inquired
2
softly
2
for
1
she
0
was
1
moved
1
by
1
the
1
sad
1
voice
1
in
1
which
1
the
1
man
1
spoke
1
Get
1
an
1
oil-can
2
and
1
oil
1
my
1
joints
1
he
1
answered
2
They
1
are
1
rusted
1
so
1
badly
2
that
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
move
1
them
1
at
1
all
1
if
1
I
1
am
1
well
1
oiled
1
I
1
shall
1
soon
1
be
1
all
1
right
1
again
2
You
1
will
1
find
1
an
1
oil-can
2
on
1
a
1
shelf
1
in
1
my
1
cottage
2
Dorothy
3
at
1
once
1
ran
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
cottage
2
and
1
found
1
the
1
oil-can
2
and
1
then
1
she
0
returned
2
and
1
asked
1
anxiously
3
Where
1
are
1
your
1
joints
1
Oil
1
my
1
neck
1
first
1
replied
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
So
1
she
0
oiled
1
it
1
and
1
as
1
it
1
was
1
quite
1
badly
2
rusted
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
took
1
hold
1
of
1
the
1
tin
1
head
2
and
1
moved
1
it
1
gently
2
from
1
side
1
to
1
side
1
until
2
it
1
worked
1
freely
2
and
1
then
1
the
1
man
1
could
1
turn
1
it
1
himself
2
Now
1
oil
1
the
1
joints
1
in
1
my
1
arms
1
he
1
said
1
And
1
Dorothy
3
oiled
1
them
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
bent
1
them
1
carefully
4
until
2
they
1
were
1
quite
1
free
1
from
1
rust
1
and
1
as
1
good
1
as
1
new
1
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
gave
1
a
1
sigh
1
of
1
satisfaction
4
and
1
lowered
2
his
1
axe
1
which
1
he
1
leaned
2
against
2
the
1
tree
1
This
1
is
1
a
1
great
2
comfort
2
he
1
said
1
I
1
have
1
been
1
holding
2
that
1
axe
1
in
1
the
1
air
1
ever
2
since
1
I
1
rusted
1
and
1
I
1
'm
0
glad
1
to
1
be
1
able
1
to
1
put
1
it
1
down
1
at
1
last
1
Now
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
oil
1
the
1
joints
1
of
1
my
1
legs
1
I
1
shall
1
be
1
all
1
right
1
once
1
more
1
So
1
they
1
oiled
1
his
1
legs
1
until
2
he
1
could
1
move
1
them
1
freely
2
and
1
he
1
thanked
1
them
1
again
2
and
1
again
2
for
1
his
1
release
3
for
1
he
1
seemed
1
a
1
very
2
polite
2
creature
3
and
1
very
2
grateful
3
I
1
might
1
have
1
stood
1
there
1
always
2
if
1
you
1
had
1
not
1
come
1
along
2
he
1
said
1
so
1
you
1
have
1
certainly
3
saved
1
my
1
life
1
How
1
did
1
you
1
happen
2
to
1
be
1
here
1
We
1
are
1
on
1
our
1
way
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
she
0
answered
2
and
1
we
1
stopped
1
at
1
your
1
cottage
2
to
1
pass
1
the
1
night
1
Why
1
do
1
you
1
wish
1
to
1
see
1
Oz
1
he
1
asked
1
I
1
want
1
him
1
to
1
send
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
wants
1
him
1
to
1
put
1
a
1
few
1
brains
1
into
2
his
1
head
2
she
0
replied
2
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
appeared
3
to
1
think
1
deeply
2
for
1
a
1
moment
2
Then
1
he
1
said
1
Do
1
you
1
suppose
2
Oz
1
could
1
give
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
Why
1
I
1
guess
1
so
1
Dorothy
3
answered
2
It
1
would
1
be
1
as
1
easy
3
as
1
to
1
give
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
brains
1
True
0
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
returned
2
So
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
allow
2
me
1
to
1
join
1
your
1
party
2
I
1
will
1
also
2
go
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
ask
1
Oz
1
to
1
help
1
me
1
Come
1
along
2
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
heartily
4
and
1
Dorothy
3
added
1
that
1
she
0
would
1
be
1
pleased
2
to
1
have
1
his
1
company
3
So
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
shouldered
2
his
1
axe
1
and
1
they
1
all
1
passed
1
through
1
the
1
forest
2
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
that
1
was
1
paved
1
with
1
yellow
2
brick
1
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
had
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
put
1
the
1
oil-can
2
in
1
her
1
basket
2
For
1
he
1
said
1
if
1
I
1
should
1
get
1
caught
1
in
1
the
1
rain
1
and
1
rust
1
again
2
I
1
would
1
need
0
the
1
oil-can
2
badly
2
It
1
was
1
a
1
bit
1
of
1
good
1
luck
1
to
1
have
1
their
1
new
1
comrade
2
join
1
the
1
party
2
for
1
soon
1
after
2
they
1
had
1
begun
2
their
1
journey
2
again
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
place
1
where
1
the
1
trees
0
and
1
branches
1
grew
1
so
1
thick
1
over
2
the
1
road
1
that
1
the
1
travelers
3
could
1
not
1
pass
1
But
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
set
1
to
1
work
1
with
1
his
1
axe
1
and
1
chopped
1
so
1
well
1
that
1
soon
1
he
1
cleared
2
a
1
passage
2
for
1
the
1
entire
2
party
2
Dorothy
3
was
1
thinking
2
so
1
earnestly
4
as
1
they
1
walked
1
along
2
that
1
she
0
did
1
not
1
notice
2
when
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
stumbled
1
into
2
a
1
hole
1
and
1
rolled
1
over
2
to
1
the
1
side
1
of
1
the
1
road
1
Indeed
1
he
1
was
1
obliged
2
to
1
call
1
to
1
her
1
to
1
help
1
him
1
up
1
again
2
Why
1
did
1
n't
0
you
1
walk
1
around
2
the
1
hole
1
asked
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
I
1
do
1
n't
0
know
1
enough
2
replied
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
cheerfully
3
My
1
head
2
is
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
you
1
know
1
and
1
that
1
is
1
why
1
I
1
am
1
going
1
to
1
Oz
1
to
1
ask
1
him
1
for
1
some
1
brains
1
Oh
1
I
1
see
1
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
But
1
after
2
all
1
brains
1
are
1
not
1
the
1
best
1
things
1
in
1
the
1
world
1
Have
1
you
1
any
2
inquired
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
No
1
my
1
head
2
is
1
quite
1
empty
2
answered
2
the
1
Woodman
2
But
1
once
1
I
1
had
1
brains
1
and
1
a
1
heart
2
also
2
so
1
having
2
tried
1
them
1
both
1
I
1
should
1
much
1
rather
2
have
1
a
1
heart
2
And
1
why
1
is
1
that
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
will
1
tell
1
you
1
my
1
story
2
and
1
then
1
you
1
will
1
know
1
So
1
while
1
they
1
were
1
walking
2
through
1
the
1
forest
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
told
1
the
1
following
3
story
2
I
1
was
1
born
1
the
1
son
1
of
1
a
1
woodman
2
who
1
chopped
1
down
1
trees
0
in
1
the
1
forest
2
and
1
sold
1
the
1
wood
1
for
1
a
1
living
2
When
1
I
1
grew
1
up
1
I
1
too
1
became
2
a
1
woodchopper
3
and
1
after
2
my
1
father
2
died
1
I
1
took
1
care
1
of
1
my
1
old
1
mother
2
as
1
long
1
as
1
she
0
lived
1
Then
1
I
1
made
1
up
1
my
1
mind
1
that
1
instead
3
of
1
living
2
alone
2
I
1
would
1
marry
2
so
1
that
1
I
1
might
1
not
1
become
2
lonely
3
There
1
was
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
Munchkin
2
girls
1
who
1
was
1
so
1
beautiful
4
that
1
I
1
soon
1
grew
1
to
1
love
1
her
1
with
1
all
1
my
1
heart
2
She
0
on
1
her
1
part
1
promised
2
to
1
marry
2
me
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
I
1
could
1
earn
2
enough
2
money
2
to
1
build
1
a
1
better
2
house
1
for
1
her
1
so
1
I
1
set
1
to
1
work
1
harder
2
than
1
ever
2
But
1
the
1
girl
1
lived
1
with
1
an
1
old
1
woman
2
who
1
did
1
not
1
want
1
her
1
to
1
marry
2
anyone
2
for
1
she
0
was
1
so
1
lazy
2
she
0
wished
1
the
1
girl
1
to
1
remain
2
with
1
her
1
and
1
do
1
the
1
cooking
2
and
1
the
1
housework
3
So
1
the
1
old
1
woman
2
went
1
to
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
and
1
promised
2
her
1
two
1
sheep
1
and
1
a
1
cow
1
if
1
she
0
would
1
prevent
2
the
1
marriage
3
Thereupon
3
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
enchanted
2
my
1
axe
1
and
1
when
1
I
1
was
1
chopping
2
away
2
at
1
my
1
best
1
one
1
day
1
for
1
I
1
was
1
anxious
2
to
1
get
1
the
1
new
1
house
1
and
1
my
1
wife
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
possible
2
the
1
axe
1
slipped
1
all
1
at
1
once
1
and
1
cut
1
off
1
my
1
left
1
leg
1
This
1
at
1
first
1
seemed
1
a
1
great
2
misfortune
3
for
1
I
1
knew
1
a
1
one-legged
3
man
1
could
1
not
1
do
1
very
2
well
1
as
1
a
1
wood-chopper
3
So
1
I
1
went
1
to
1
a
1
tinsmith
2
and
1
had
1
him
1
make
1
me
1
a
1
new
1
leg
1
out
1
of
1
tin
1
The
1
leg
1
worked
1
very
2
well
1
once
1
I
1
was
1
used
1
to
1
it
1
But
1
my
1
action
2
angered
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
for
1
she
0
had
1
promised
2
the
1
old
1
woman
2
I
1
should
1
not
1
marry
2
the
1
pretty
2
Munchkin
2
girl
1
When
1
I
1
began
2
chopping
2
again
2
my
1
axe
1
slipped
1
and
1
cut
1
off
1
my
1
right
1
leg
1
Again
2
I
1
went
1
to
1
the
1
tinsmith
2
and
1
again
2
he
1
made
1
me
1
a
1
leg
1
out
1
of
1
tin
1
After
2
this
1
the
1
enchanted
2
axe
1
cut
1
off
1
my
1
arms
1
one
1
after
2
the
1
other
2
but
1
nothing
2
daunted
1
I
1
had
1
them
1
replaced
2
with
1
tin
1
ones
1
The
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
then
1
made
1
the
1
axe
1
slip
1
and
1
cut
1
off
1
my
1
head
2
and
1
at
1
first
1
I
1
thought
1
that
1
was
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
me
1
But
1
the
1
tinsmith
2
happened
2
to
1
come
1
along
2
and
1
he
1
made
1
me
1
a
1
new
1
head
2
out
1
of
1
tin
1
I
1
thought
1
I
1
had
1
beaten
3
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
then
1
and
1
I
1
worked
1
harder
2
than
1
ever
2
but
1
I
1
little
1
knew
1
how
1
cruel
1
my
1
enemy
3
could
1
be
1
She
0
thought
1
of
1
a
1
new
1
way
1
to
1
kill
1
my
1
love
1
for
1
the
1
beautiful
4
Munchkin
2
maiden
2
and
1
made
1
my
1
axe
1
slip
1
again
2
so
1
that
1
it
1
cut
1
right
1
through
1
my
1
body
2
splitting
2
me
1
into
2
two
1
halves
1
Once
1
more
1
the
1
tinsmith
2
came
1
to
1
my
1
help
1
and
1
made
1
me
1
a
1
body
2
of
1
tin
1
fastening
3
my
1
tin
1
arms
1
and
1
legs
1
and
1
head
2
to
1
it
1
by
1
means
2
of
1
joints
1
so
1
that
1
I
1
could
1
move
1
around
2
as
1
well
1
as
1
ever
2
But
1
alas
2
I
1
had
1
now
1
no
1
heart
2
so
1
that
1
I
1
lost
1
all
1
my
1
love
1
for
1
the
1
Munchkin
2
girl
1
and
1
did
1
not
1
care
1
whether
2
I
1
married
2
her
1
or
1
not
1
I
1
suppose
2
she
0
is
1
still
1
living
2
with
1
the
1
old
1
woman
2
waiting
2
for
1
me
1
to
1
come
1
after
2
her
1
My
1
body
2
shone
1
so
1
brightly
2
in
1
the
1
sun
1
that
1
I
1
felt
1
very
2
proud
1
of
1
it
1
and
1
it
1
did
1
not
1
matter
2
now
1
if
1
my
1
axe
1
slipped
1
for
1
it
1
could
1
not
1
cut
1
me
1
There
1
was
1
only
2
one
1
danger
2
that
1
my
1
joints
1
would
1
rust
1
but
1
I
1
kept
1
an
1
oil-can
2
in
1
my
1
cottage
2
and
1
took
1
care
1
to
1
oil
1
myself
2
whenever
3
I
1
needed
1
it
1
However
3
there
1
came
1
a
1
day
1
when
1
I
1
forgot
2
to
1
do
1
this
1
and
1
being
1
caught
1
in
1
a
1
rainstorm
2
before
2
I
1
thought
1
of
1
the
1
danger
2
my
1
joints
1
had
1
rusted
1
and
1
I
1
was
1
left
1
to
1
stand
1
in
1
the
1
woods
1
until
2
you
1
came
1
to
1
help
1
me
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
terrible
2
thing
1
to
1
undergo
3
but
1
during
2
the
1
year
2
I
1
stood
1
there
1
I
1
had
1
time
1
to
1
think
1
that
1
the
1
greatest
3
loss
1
I
1
had
1
known
1
was
1
the
1
loss
1
of
1
my
1
heart
2
While
1
I
1
was
1
in
1
love
1
I
1
was
1
the
1
happiest
3
man
1
on
1
earth
2
but
1
no
1
one
1
can
1
love
1
who
1
has
1
not
1
a
1
heart
2
and
1
so
1
I
1
am
1
resolved
2
to
1
ask
1
Oz
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
one
1
If
1
he
1
does
0
I
1
will
1
go
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
Munchkin
2
maiden
2
and
1
marry
2
her
1
Both
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
had
1
been
1
greatly
3
interested
3
in
1
the
1
story
2
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
now
1
they
1
knew
1
why
1
he
1
was
1
so
1
anxious
2
to
1
get
1
a
1
new
1
heart
2
All
1
the
1
same
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
shall
1
ask
1
for
1
brains
1
instead
3
of
1
a
1
heart
2
for
1
a
1
fool
1
would
1
not
1
know
1
what
1
to
1
do
1
with
1
a
1
heart
2
if
1
he
1
had
1
one
1
I
1
shall
1
take
1
the
1
heart
2
returned
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
for
1
brains
1
do
1
not
1
make
1
one
1
happy
2
and
1
happiness
3
is
1
the
1
best
1
thing
1
in
1
the
1
world
1
Dorothy
3
did
1
not
1
say
1
anything
3
for
1
she
0
was
1
puzzled
1
to
1
know
1
which
1
of
1
her
1
two
1
friends
2
was
1
right
1
and
1
she
0
decided
2
if
1
she
0
could
1
only
2
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
it
1
did
1
not
1
matter
2
so
1
much
1
whether
2
the
1
Woodman
2
had
1
no
1
brains
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
no
1
heart
2
or
1
each
2
got
1
what
1
he
1
wanted
1
What
1
worried
2
her
1
most
1
was
1
that
1
the
1
bread
2
was
1
nearly
3
gone
1
and
1
another
3
meal
2
for
1
herself
2
and
1
Toto
2
would
1
empty
2
the
1
basket
2
To
1
be
1
sure
1
neither
2
the
1
Woodman
2
nor
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
ever
2
ate
1
anything
3
but
1
she
0
was
1
not
1
made
1
of
1
tin
1
nor
1
straw
1
and
1
could
1
not
1
live
1
unless
2
she
0
was
1
fed
0
All
1
this
1
time
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
companions
3
had
1
been
1
walking
2
through
1
the
1
thick
1
woods
1
The
1
road
1
was
1
still
1
paved
1
with
1
yellow
2
brick
1
but
1
these
1
were
1
much
1
covered
2
by
1
dried
1
branches
1
and
1
dead
2
leaves
2
from
1
the
1
trees
0
and
1
the
1
walking
2
was
1
not
1
at
1
all
1
good
1
There
1
were
1
few
1
birds
1
in
1
this
1
part
1
of
1
the
1
forest
2
for
1
birds
1
love
1
the
1
open
2
country
2
where
1
there
1
is
1
plenty
2
of
1
sunshine
2
But
1
now
1
and
1
then
1
there
1
came
1
a
1
deep
1
growl
1
from
1
some
1
wild
1
animal
3
hidden
2
among
2
the
1
trees
0
These
1
sounds
1
made
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
's
0
heart
2
beat
2
fast
1
for
1
she
0
did
1
not
1
know
1
what
1
made
1
them
1
but
1
Toto
2
knew
1
and
1
he
1
walked
1
close
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
side
1
and
1
did
1
not
1
even
2
bark
1
in
1
return
2
How
1
long
1
will
1
it
1
be
1
the
1
child
1
asked
1
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
before
2
we
1
are
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
forest
2
I
1
can
1
not
1
tell
1
was
1
the
1
answer
2
for
1
I
1
have
1
never
2
been
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
But
1
my
1
father
2
went
1
there
1
once
1
when
1
I
1
was
1
a
1
boy
1
and
1
he
1
said
1
it
1
was
1
a
1
long
1
journey
2
through
1
a
1
dangerous
3
country
2
although
2
nearer
3
to
1
the
1
city
2
where
1
Oz
1
dwells
1
the
1
country
2
is
1
beautiful
4
But
1
I
1
am
1
not
1
afraid
2
so
1
long
1
as
1
I
1
have
1
my
1
oil-can
2
and
1
nothing
2
can
1
hurt
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
while
1
you
1
bear
2
upon
2
your
1
forehead
4
the
1
mark
1
of
1
the
1
Good
1
Witch
1
's
0
kiss
1
and
1
that
1
will
1
protect
2
you
1
from
1
harm
1
But
1
Toto
2
said
1
the
1
girl
1
anxiously
3
What
1
will
1
protect
2
him
1
We
1
must
1
protect
2
him
1
ourselves
2
if
1
he
1
is
1
in
1
danger
2
replied
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
Just
1
as
1
he
1
spoke
1
there
1
came
1
from
1
the
1
forest
2
a
1
terrible
2
roar
1
and
1
the
1
next
1
moment
2
a
1
great
2
Lion
1
bounded
1
into
2
the
1
road
1
With
1
one
1
blow
1
of
1
his
1
paw
1
he
1
sent
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
spinning
2
over
2
and
1
over
2
to
1
the
1
edge
1
of
1
the
1
road
1
and
1
then
1
he
1
struck
1
at
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
with
1
his
1
sharp
1
claws
1
But
1
to
1
the
1
Lion
1
's
0
surprise
2
he
1
could
1
make
1
no
1
impression
3
on
1
the
1
tin
1
although
2
the
1
Woodman
2
fell
1
over
2
in
1
the
1
road
1
and
1
lay
1
still
1
Little
1
Toto
2
now
1
that
1
he
1
had
1
an
1
enemy
3
to
1
face
1
ran
1
barking
2
toward
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
the
1
great
2
beast
2
had
1
opened
2
his
1
mouth
1
to
1
bite
1
the
1
dog
1
when
1
Dorothy
3
fearing
3
Toto
2
would
1
be
1
killed
1
and
1
heedless
2
of
1
danger
2
rushed
1
forward
2
and
1
slapped
1
the
1
Lion
1
upon
2
his
1
nose
1
as
1
hard
1
as
1
she
0
could
1
while
1
she
0
cried
1
out
1
Do
1
n't
0
you
1
dare
1
to
1
bite
1
Toto
2
You
1
ought
1
to
1
be
1
ashamed
2
of
1
yourself
2
a
1
big
1
beast
2
like
1
you
1
to
1
bite
1
a
1
poor
1
little
1
dog
1
I
1
did
1
n't
0
bite
1
him
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
as
1
he
1
rubbed
1
his
1
nose
1
with
1
his
1
paw
1
where
1
Dorothy

1
No
1
but
1
you

tried

to

she

retorted
2
You
1
are
1
nothing
2
but
1
a
1
big
1
coward
2
I
1
know
1
it
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
hanging
2
his
1
head
2
in
1
shame
1
I
1
've
0
always
2
known
1
it
1
But
1
how
1
can
1
I
1
help
1
it
1
I
1
do
1
n't

know
1
I
1
'm
0
sure
1
To
1
think
1
of
1
your
1
striking
2
a
1
stuffed
1
man
1
like
1
the
1
poor
1
Scarecrow
3
Is
1
he
1
stuffed
1
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
in
1
surprise
2
as
1
he
1
watched
1
her
1
pick
1
up
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
set
1
him
1
upon
2
his
1
feet
1
while
1
she
0
patted
1
him
1
into
2
shape
1
again
2
Of
1
course
1
he
1
's
0
stuffed
1
replied
2
Dorothy
3
who
1
was
1
still
1
angry
2
That
1
's
0
why
1
he
1
went
1
over
2
so
1
easily
4
remarked
2
the
1
Lion
1
It
1
astonished
3
me
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
whirl
1
around
2
so
1
Is
1
the
1
other
2
one
1
stuffed
1
also
2
No
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
he
1
's
0
made
1
of
1
tin
1
And
1
she
0
helped
1
the
1
Woodman
2
up
1
again
2
That
1
's
0
why
1
he
1
nearly
3
blunted
1
my
1
claws
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
When
1
they
1
scratched
1
against
2
the
1
tin
1
it
1
made
1
a
1
cold
1
shiver
2
run
1
down
1
my
1
back
1
What
1
is
1
that
1
little
1
animal
3
you
1
are
1
so
1
tender
2
of
1
He
1
is
1
my
1
dog
1
Toto
2
answered
2
Dorothy
3
Is
1
he
1
made
1
of
1
tin
1
or
1
stuffed
1
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
Neither
2
He
1
's
0
a
1
a
1
a
1
meat
2
dog
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
Oh
1
He
1
's
0
a
1
curious
2
animal
3
and
1
seems
1
remarkably
4
small
1
now
1
that
1
I
1
look
1
at
1
him
1
No
1
one
1
would
1
think
1
of
1
biting
2
such
1
a
1
little
1
thing
1
except
2
a
1
coward
2
like
1
me
1
continued
2
the
1
Lion
1
sadly
2
What
1
makes
1
you
1
a
1
coward
2
asked
1
Dorothy
3
looking
2
at
1
the
1
great
2
beast
2
in
1
wonder
2
for
1
he
1
was
1
as
1
big
1
as
1
a
1
small
1
horse
1
It
1
's
0
a
1
mystery
3
replied
2
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
suppose
2
I
1
was
1
born
1
that
1
way
1
All
1
the
1
other
2
animals
3
in
1
the
1
forest
2
naturally
4
expect
2
me
1
to
1
be
1
brave
1
for
1
the
1
Lion
1
is
1
everywhere
4
thought
1
to
1
be
1
the
1
King
1
of
1
Beasts
2
I
1
learned
2
that
1
if
1
I
1
roared
1
very
2
loudly
2
every
3
living
2
thing
1
was
1
frightened
2
and
1
got
1
out
1
of
1
my
1
way
1
Whenever
3
I
1
've
0
met
1
a
1
man
1
I
1
've
0
been
1
awfully
3
scared
1
but
1
I
1
just
1
roared
1
at
1
him
1
and
1
he
1
has
1
always
2
run
1
away
2
as
1
fast
1
as
1
he
1
could
1
go
1
If
1
the
1
elephants
3
and
1
the
1
tigers
2
and
1
the
1
bears
2
had
1
ever
2
tried
1
to
1
fight
1
me
1
I
1
should
1
have
1
run
1
myself
2
I
1
'm
0
such
1
a
1
coward
2
but
1
just
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
they
1
hear
2
me
1
roar
1
they
1
all
1
try
1
to
1
get
1
away
2
from
1
me
1
and
1
of
1
course
1
I
1
let
1
them
1
go
1
But
1
that
1
is
1
n't
0
right
1
The
1
King
1
of
1
Beasts
2
should
1
n't
0
be
1
a
1
coward
2
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
know
1
it
1
returned
2
the
1
Lion
1
wiping
2
a
1
tear
2
from
1
his
1
eye
0
with
1
the
1
tip
1
of
1
his
1
tail
1
It
1
is
1
my
1
great
2
sorrow
2
and
1
makes
1
my
1
life
1
very
2
unhappy
3
But
1
whenever
3
there
1
is
1
danger
2
my
1
heart
2
begins
2
to
1
beat
2
fast
1
Perhaps
2
you
1
have
1
heart
2
disease
3
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
It
1
may
1
be
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
If
1
you
1
have
1
continued
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
you
1
ought
1
to
1
be
1
glad
1
for
1
it
1
proves
1
you
1
have
1
a
1
heart
2
For
1
my
1
part
1
I
1
have
1
no
1
heart
2
so
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
have
1
heart
2
disease
3
Perhaps
2
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
thoughtfully
3
if
1
I
1
had
1
no
1
heart
2
I
1
should
1
not
1
be
1
a
1
coward
2
Have
1
you
1
brains
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
suppose
2
so
1
I
1
've
0
never
2
looked
1
to
1
see
1
replied
2
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
am
1
going
1
to
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
to
1
ask
1
him
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
some
1
remarked
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
for
1
my
1
head
2
is
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
And
1
I
1
am
1
going
1
to
1
ask
1
him
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
And
1
I
1
am
1
going
1
to
1
ask
1
him
1
to
1
send
1
Toto
2
and
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
added
1
Dorothy
3
Do
1
you
1
think
1
Oz
1
could
1
give
1
me
1
courage
2
asked
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
Just
1
as
1
easily
4
as
1
he
1
could
1
give
1
me
1
brains
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Or
1
give
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
Or
1
send
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
Then
1
if
1
you
1
do
1
n't
0
mind
1
I
1
'll
0
go
1
with
1
you
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
for
1
my
1
life
1
is
1
simply
2
unbearable
4
without
2
a
1
bit
1
of
1
courage
2
You
1
will
1
be
1
very
2
welcome
2
answered
2
Dorothy
3
for
1
you
1
will
1
help
1
to
1
keep
1
away
2
the
1
other
2
wild
1
beasts
2
It
1
seems
1
to
1
me
1
they
1
must
1
be
1
more
1
cowardly
3
than
1
you
1
are
1
if
1
they
1
allow
2
you
1
to
1
scare
1
them
1
so
1
easily
4
They
1
really
3
are
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
but
1
that
1
does
0
n't
0
make
1
me
1
any
2
braver
2
and
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
I
1
know
1
myself
2
to
1
be
1
a
1
coward
2
I
1
shall
1
be
1
unhappy
3
So
1
once
1
more
1
the
1
little
1
company
3
set
1
off
1
upon
2
the
1
journey
2
the
1
Lion
1
walking
2
with
1
stately
3
strides
1
at
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
side
1
Toto
2
did
1
not
1
approve
2
of
1
this
1
new
1
comrade
2
at
1
first
1
for
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
forget
2
how
1
nearly
3
he
1
had
1
been
1
crushed
1
between
2
the
1
Lion
1
's
0
great
2
jaws
1
But
1
after
2
a
1
time
1
he
1
became
2
more
1
at
1
ease
2
and
1
presently
3
Toto
2
and
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
had
1
grown
1
to
1
be
1
good
1
friends
2
During
2
the
1
rest
1
of
1
that
1
day
1
there
1
was
1
no
1
other
2
adventure
3
to
1
mar
1
the
1
peace
2
of
1
their
1
journey
2
Once
1
indeed
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
stepped
1
upon
2
a
1
beetle
1
that
1
was
1
crawling
2
along
2
the
1
road
1
and
1
killed
1
the
1
poor
1
little
1
thing
1
This
1
made
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
very
2
unhappy
3
for
1
he
1
was
1
always
2
careful
3
not
1
to
1
hurt
1
any
2
living
2
creature
3
and
1
as
1
he
1
walked
1
along
2
he
1
wept
1
several
3
tears
2
of
1
sorrow
2
and
1
regret
2
These
1
tears
2
ran
1
slowly
2
down
1
his
1
face
1
and
1
over
2
the
1
hinges
1
of
1
his
1
jaw
1
and
1
there
1
they
1
rusted
1
When
1
Dorothy
3
presently
3
asked
1
him
1
a
1
question
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
could
1
not
1
open
2
his
1
mouth
1
for
1
his
1
jaws
1
were
1
tightly
2
rusted
1
together
3
He
1
became
2
greatly
3
frightened
2
at
1
this
1
and
1
made
1
many
2
motions
2
to
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
relieve
3
him
1
but
1
she
0
could
1
not
1
understand
3
The
1
Lion
1
was
1
also
2
puzzled
1
to
1
know
1
what
1
was
1
wrong
1
But
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
seized
1
the
1
oil-can
2
from
1
Dorothy's
3
basket
2
and
1
oiled
1
the
1
Woodman
2
's
0
jaws
1
so
1
that
1
after
2
a
1
few
1
moments
2
he
1
could
1
talk
1
as
1
well
1
as
1
before
2
This
1
will
1
serve
1
me
1
a
1
lesson
2
said
1
he
1
to
1
look
1
where
1
I
1
step
1
For
1
if
1
I
1
should
1
kill
1
another
3
bug
1
or
1
beetle
1
I
1
should
1
surely
3
cry
1
again
2
and
1
crying
1
rusts
1
my
1
jaws
1
so
1
that
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
speak
2
Thereafter
4
he
1
walked
1
very
2
carefully
4
with
1
his
1
eyes
0
on
1
the
1
road
1
and
1
when
1
he
1
saw
1
a
1
tiny
2
ant
1
toiling
2
by
1
he
1
would
1
step
1
over
2
it
1
so
1
as
1
not
1
to
1
harm
1
it
1
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
knew
1
very
2
well
1
he
1
had
1
no
1
heart
2
and
1
therefore
3
he
1
took
1
great
2
care
1
never
2
to
1
be
1
cruel
1
or
1
unkind
2
to
1
anything
3
You
1
people
1
with
1
hearts
2
he
1
said
1
have
1
something
3
to
1
guide
1
you
1
and
1
need
0
never
2
do
1
wrong
1
but
1
I
1
have
1
no
1
heart
2
and
1
so
1
I
1
must
1
be
1
very
2
careful
3
When
1
Oz
1
gives
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
of
1
course
1
I
1
need
0
n't
0
mind
1
so
1
much
1
They
1
were
1
obliged
2
to
1
camp
1
out
1
that
1
night
1
under
2
a
1
large
1
tree
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
for
1
there
1
were
1
no
1
houses
1
near
2
The
1
tree
1
made
1
a
1
good
1
thick
1
covering
3
to
1
protect
2
them
1
from
1
the
1
dew
1
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
chopped
1
a
1
great
2
pile
1
of
1
wood
1
with
1
his
1
axe
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
built
1
a
1
splendid
2
fire
1
that
1
warmed
1
her
1
and
1
made
1
her
1
feel
1
less
1
lonely
3
She
0
and
1
Toto
2
ate
1
the
1
last
1
of
1
their
1
bread
2
and
1
now
1
she
0
did
1
not
1
know
1
what
1
they
1
would
1
do
1
for
1
breakfast
3
If
1
you
1
wish
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
will
1
go
1
into
2
the
1
forest
2
and
1
kill
1
a
1
deer
1
for
1
you
1
You
1
can
1
roast
1
it
1
by
1
the
1
fire
1
since
1
your
1
tastes
1
are
1
so
1
peculiar
4
that
1
you
1
prefer
2
cooked
1
food
1
and
1
then
1
you
1
will
1
have
1
a
1
very
2
good
1
breakfast
3
Do
1
n't
0
Please
2
do
1
n't
0
begged
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
I
1
should
1
certainly
3
weep
1
if
1
you
1
killed
1
a
1
poor
1
deer
1
and
1
then
1
my
1
jaws
1
would
1
rust
1
again
2
But
1
the
1
Lion
1
went
1
away
2
into
2
the
1
forest
2
and
1
found
1
his
1
own
1
supper
2
and
1
no
1
one
1
ever
2
knew
1
what
1
it
1
was
1
for
1
he
1
did
1
n't
0
mention
2
it
1
And
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
found
1
a
1
tree
1
full
1
of
1
nuts
1
and
1
filled
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
basket
2
with
1
them
1
so
1
that
1
she
0
would
1
not
1
be
1
hungry
2
for
1
a
1
long
1
time
1
She
0
thought
1
this
1
was
1
very
2
kind
1
and
1
thoughtful
2
of
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
she
0
laughed
1
heartily
4
at
1
the
1
awkward
2
way
1
in
1
which
1
the
1
poor
1
creature
3
picked
1
up
1
the
1
nuts
1
His
1
padded
1
hands
1
were
1
so
1
clumsy
2
and
1
the
1
nuts
1
were
1
so
1
small
1
that
1
he
1
dropped
1
almost
2
as
1
many
2
as
1
he
1
put
1
in
1
the
1
basket
2
But
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
did
1
not
1
mind
1
how
1
long
1
it
1
took
1
him
1
to
1
fill
1
the
1
basket
2
for
1
it
1
enabled
2
him
1
to
1
keep
1
away
2
from
1
the
1
fire
1
as
1
he
1
feared
2
a
1
spark
1
might
1
get
1
into
2
his
1
straw
1
and
1
burn
1
him
1
up
1
So
1
he
1
kept
1
a
1
good
1
distance
2
away
2
from
1
the
1
flames
1
and
1
only
2
came
1
near
2
to
1
cover
2
Dorothy
3
with
1
dry
1
leaves
2
when
1
she
0
lay
1
down
1
to
1
sleep
1
These
1
kept
1
her
1
very
2
snug
1
and
1
warm
1
and
1
she
0
slept
1
soundly
2
until
2
morning
2
When
1
it
1
was
1
daylight
2
the
1
girl
1
bathed
1
her
1
face
1
in
1
a
1
little
1
rippling
2
brook
1
and
1
soon
1
after
2
they
1
all
1
started
1
toward
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
This
1
was
1
to
1
be
1
an
1
eventful
3
day
1
for
1
the
1
travelers
3
They
1
had
1
hardly
2
been
1
walking
2
an
1
hour
1
when
1
they
1
saw
1
before
2
them
1
a
1
great
2
ditch
1
that
1
crossed
1
the
1
road
1
and
1
divided
2
the
1
forest
2
as
1
far
1
as
1
they
1
could
1
see
1
on
1
either
2
side
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
very
2
wide
1
ditch
1
and
1
when
1
they
1
crept
1
up
1
to
1
the
1
edge
1
and
1
looked
1
into
2
it
1
they
1
could
1
see
1
it
1
was
1
also
2
very
2
deep
1
and
1
there
1
were
1
many
2
big
1
jagged
1
rocks
1
at
1
the
1
bottom
2
The
1
sides
1
were
1
so
1
steep
1
that
1
none
1
of
1
them
1
could
1
climb
1
down
1
and
1
for
1
a
1
moment
2
it
1
seemed
1
that
1
their
1
journey
2
must
1
end
1
What
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
despairingly
4
I
1
have
1
n't
0
the
1
faintest
2
idea
3
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
shook
1
his
1
shaggy
2
mane
1
and
1
looked
1
thoughtful
2
But
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
said
1
We
1
can
1
not
1
fly
1
that
1
is
1
certain
2
Neither
2
can
1
we
1
climb
1
down
1
into
2
this
1
great
2
ditch
1
Therefore
3
if
1
we
1
can
1
not
1
jump
1
over
2
it
1
we
1
must
1
stop
1
where
1
we
1
are
1
I
1
think
1
I
1
could
1
jump
1
over
2
it
1
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
after
2
measuring
4
the
1
distance
2
carefully
4
in
1
his
1
mind
1
Then
1
we
1
are
1
all
1
right
1
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
for
1
you
1
can
1
carry
2
us
1
all
1
over
2
on
1
your
1
back
1
one
1
at
1
a
1
time
1
Well
1
I
1
'll
0
try
1
it
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
Who
1
will
1
go
1
first
1
I
1
will
1
declared
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
for
1
if
1
you
1
found
1
that
1
you
1
could
1
not
1
jump
1
over
2
the
1
gulf
1
Dorothy
3
would
1
be
1
killed
1
or
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
badly
2
dented
1
on
1
the
1
rocks
1
below
2
But
1
if
1
I
1
am
1
on
1
your
1
back
1
it
1
will
1
not
1
matter
2
so
1
much
1
for
1
the
1
fall
1
would
1
not
1
hurt
1
me
1
at
1
all
1
I
1
am
1
terribly
3
afraid
2
of
1
falling
2
myself
2
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
but
1
I
1
suppose
2
there
1
is
1
nothing
2
to
1
do
1
but
1
try
1
it
1
So
1
get
1
on
1
my
1
back
1
and
1
we
1
will
1
make
1
the
1
attempt
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
sat
1
upon
2
the
1
Lion
1
's
0
back
1
and
1
the
1
big
1
beast
2
walked
1
to
1
the
1
edge
1
of
1
the
1
gulf
1
and
1
crouched
1
down
1
Why
1
do
1
n't
0
you
1
run
1
and
1
jump
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Because
2
that
1
is
1
n't
0
the
1
way
1
we
1
Lions
1
do
1
these
1
things
1
he
1
replied
2
Then
1
giving
2
a
1
great
2
spring
1
he
1
shot
1
through
1
the
1
air
1
and
1
landed
1
safely
3
on
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
They
1
were
1
all
1
greatly
3
pleased
2
to
1
see
1
how
1
easily
4
he
1
did
1
it
1
and
1
after
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
had
1
got
1
down
1
from
1
his
1
back
1
the
1
Lion
1
sprang
1
across
2
the
1
ditch
1
again
2
Dorothy
3
thought
1
she
0
would
1
go
1
next
1
so
1
she
0
took
1
Toto
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
and
1
climbed
1
on
1
the
1
Lion
1
's
0
back
1
holding
2
tightly
2
to
1
his
1
mane
1
with
1
one
1
hand
1
The
1
next
1
moment
2
it
1
seemed
1
as
1
if
1
she
0
were
1
flying
1
through
1
the
1
air
1
and
1
then
1
before
2
she
0
had
1
time
1
to
1
think
1
about
2
it
1
she
0
was
1
safe
1
on
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
The
1
Lion
1
went
1
back
1
a
1
third
1
time
1
and
1
got
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
then
1
they
1
all
1
sat
1
down
1
for
1
a
1
few
1
moments
2
to
1
give
1
the
1
beast
2
a
1
chance
1
to
1
rest
1
for
1
his
1
great
2
leaps
2
had
1
made
1
his
1
breath
2
short
1
and
1
he
1
panted
1
like
1
a
1
big
1
dog
1
that
1
has
1
been
1
running
2
too
1
long
1
They
1
found
1
the
1
forest
2
very
2
thick
1
on
1
this
1
side
1
and
1
it
1
looked
1
dark
1
and
1
gloomy
2
After
2
the
1
Lion
1
had
1
rested
1
they
1
started
1
along
2
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
silently
3
wondering
3
each
2
in
1
his
1
own
1
mind
1
if
1
ever
2
they
1
would
1
come
1
to
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
the
1
woods
1
and
1
reach
2
the
1
bright
1
sunshine
2
again
2
To
1
add
1
to
1
their
1
discomfort
3
they
1
soon
1
heard
2
strange
1
noises
1
in
1
the
1
depths
1
of
1
the
1
forest
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
whispered
2
to
1
them
1
that
1
it
1
was
1
in
1
this
1
part
1
of
1
the
1
country
2
that
1
the
1
Kalidahs
3
lived
1
What
1
are
1
the
1
Kalidahs
3
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
They
1
are
1
monstrous
2
beasts
2
with
1
bodies
2
like
1
bears
2
and
1
heads
2
like
1
tigers
2
replied
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
with
1
claws
1
so
1
long
1
and
1
sharp
1
that
1
they
1
could
1
tear
2
me
1
in
1
two
1
as
1
easily
4
as
1
I
1
could
1
kill
1
Toto
2
I
1
'm
0
terribly
3
afraid
2
of
1
the
1
Kalidahs
3
I
1
'm
0
not
1
surprised
2
that
1
you
1
are
1
returned
2
Dorothy
3
They
1
must
1
be
1
dreadful
3
beasts
2
The
1
Lion
1
was
1
about
2
to
1
reply
2
when
1
suddenly
3
they
1
came
1
to
1
another
3
gulf
1
across
2
the
1
road
1
But
1
this
1
one
1
was
1
so
1
broad
1
and
1
deep
1
that
1
the
1
Lion
1
knew
1
at
1
once
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
leap
2
across
2
it
1
So
1
they
1
sat
1
down
1
to
1
consider
3
what
1
they
1
should
1
do
1
and
1
after
2
serious
2
thought
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
said
1
Here
1
is
1
a
1
great
2
tree
1
standing
2
close
1
to
1
the
1
ditch
1
If
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
can
1
chop
1
it
1
down
1
so
1
that
1
it
1
will
1
fall
1
to
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
we
1
can
1
walk
1
across
2
it
1
easily
4
That
1
is
1
a
1
first-rate
2
idea
3
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
One
1
would
1
almost
2
suspect
2
you
1
had
1
brains
1
in
1
your
1
head
2
instead
3
of
1
straw
1
The
1
Woodman
2
set
1
to
1
work
1
at
1
once
1
and
1
so
1
sharp
1
was
1
his
1
axe
1
that
1
the
1
tree
1
was
1
soon
1
chopped
1
nearly
3
through
1
Then
1
the
1
Lion
1
put
1
his
1
strong
1
front
1
legs
1
against
2
the
1
tree
1
and
1
pushed
1
with
1
all
1
his
1
might
1
and
1
slowly
2
the
1
big
1
tree
1
tipped
1
and
1
fell
1
with
1
a
1
crash
1
across
2
the
1
ditch
1
with
1
its
1
top
1
branches
1
on
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
They
1
had
1
just
1
started
1
to
1
cross
1
this
1
queer
1
bridge
1
when
1
a
1
sharp
1
growl
1
made
1
them
1
all
1
look
1
up
1
and
1
to
1
their
1
horror
2
they
1
saw
1
running
2
toward
2
them
1
two
1
great
2
beasts
2
with
1
bodies
2
like
1
bears
2
and
1
heads
2
like
1
tigers
2
They
1
are
1
the
1
Kalidahs
3
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
beginning
3
to
1
tremble
1
Quick
1
cried
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Let
1
us
1
cross
1
over
2
So
1
Dorothy
3
went
1
first
1
holding
2
Toto
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
followed
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
came
1
next
1
The
1
Lion
1
although
2
he
1
was
1
certainly
3
afraid
2
turned
1
to
1
face
1
the
1
Kalidahs
3
and
1
then
1
he
1
gave
1
so
1
loud
1
and
1
terrible
2
a
1
roar
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
screamed
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
fell
1
over
2
backward
2
while
1
even
2
the
1
fierce
2
beasts
2
stopped
1
short
1
and
1
looked
1
at
1
him
1
in
1
surprise
2
But
1
seeing
1
they
1
were
1
bigger
2
than
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
remembering
4
that
1
there
1
were
1
two
1
of
1
them
1
and
1
only
2
one
1
of
1
him
1
the
1
Kalidahs
3
again
2
rushed
1
forward
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
crossed
1
over
2
the
1
tree
1
and
1
turned
1
to
1
see
1
what
1
they
1
would
1
do
1
next
1
Without
2
stopping
2
an
1
instant
2
the
1
fierce
2
beasts
2
also
2
began
2
to
1
cross
1
the
1
tree
1
And
1
the
1
Lion
1
said
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
We
1
are
1
lost
1
for
1
they
1
will
1
surely
3
tear
2
us
1
to
1
pieces
2
with
1
their
1
sharp
1
claws
1
But
1
stand
1
close
1
behind
2
me
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
fight
1
them
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
I
1
am
1
alive
2
Wait
1
a
1
minute
2
called
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
He
1
had
1
been
1
thinking
2
what
1
was
1
best
1
to
1
be
1
done
1
and
1
now
1
he
1
asked
1
the
1
Woodman
2
to
1
chop
1
away
2
the
1
end
1
of
1
the
1
tree
1
that
1
rested
1
on
1
their
1
side
1
of
1
the
1
ditch
1
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
began
2
to
1
use
1
his
1
axe
1
at
1
once
1
and
1
just
1
as
1
the
1
two
1
Kalidahs
3
were
1
nearly
3
across
2
the
1
tree
1
fell
1
with
1
a
1
crash
1
into
2
the
1
gulf
1
carrying
2
the
1
ugly
2
snarling
2
brutes
1
with
1
it
1
and
1
both
1
were
1
dashed
1
to
1
pieces
2
on
1
the
1
sharp
1
rocks
1
at
1
the
1
bottom
2
Well
1
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
drawing
2
a
1
long
1
breath
2
of
1
relief
3
I
1
see
1
we
1
are
1
going
1
to
1
live
1
a
1
little
1
while
1
longer
2
and
1
I
1
am
1
glad
1
of
1
it
1
for
1
it
1
must
1
be
1
a
1
very
2
uncomfortable
4
thing
1
not
1
to
1
be
1
alive
2
Those
1
creatures
3
frightened
2
me
1
so
1
badly
2
that
1
my
1
heart
2
is
1
beating
3
yet
1
Ah
1
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
sadly
2
I
1
wish
1
I
1
had
1
a
1
heart
2
to
1
beat
2
This
1
adventure
3
made
1
the
1
travelers
3
more
1
anxious
2
than
1
ever
2
to
1
get
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
forest
2
and
1
they
1
walked
1
so
1
fast
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
became
2
tired
1
and
1
had
1
to
1
ride
1
on
1
the
1
Lion
1
's
0
back
1
To
1
their
1
great
2
joy
1
the
1
trees
0
became
2
thinner
2
the
1
farther
2
they
1
advanced
2
and
1
in
1
the
1
afternoon
3
they
1
suddenly
3
came
1
upon
2
a
1
broad
1
river
2
flowing
2
swiftly
2
just
1
before
2
them
1
On
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
of
1
the
1
water
2
they
1
could
1
see
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
running
2
through
1
a
1
beautiful
4
country
2
with
1
green
1
meadows
3
dotted
1
with
1
bright
1
flowers
2
and
1
all
1
the
1
road
1
bordered
2
with
1
trees
0
hanging
2
full
1
of
1
delicious
3
fruits
1
They
1
were
1
greatly
3
pleased
2
to
1
see
1
this
1
delightful
3
country
2
before
2
them
1
How
1
shall
1
we
1
cross
1
the
1
river
2
asked
1
Dorothy
3
That
1
is
1
easily
4
done
1
replied
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
must
1
build
1
us
1
a
1
raft
1
so
1
we
1
can
1
float
1
to
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
So
1
the
1
Woodman
2
took
1
his
1
axe
1
and
1
began
2
to
1
chop
1
down
1
small
1
trees
0
to
1
make
1
a
1
raft
1
and
1
while
1
he
1
was
1
busy
2
at
1
this
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
found
1
on
1
the
1
riverbank
3
a
1
tree
1
full
1
of
1
fine
1
fruit
1
This
1
pleased
2
Dorothy
3
who
1
had
1
eaten
3
nothing
2
but
1
nuts
1
all
1
day
1
and
1
she
0
made
1
a
1
hearty
3
meal
2
of
1
the
1
ripe
1
fruit
1
But
1
it
1
takes
1
time
1
to
1
make
1
a
1
raft
1
even
2
when
1
one
1
is
1
as
1
industrious
3
and
1
untiring
3
as
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
when
1
night
1
came
1
the
1
work
1
was
1
not
1
done
1
So
1
they
1
found
1
a
1
cozy
2
place
1
under
2
the
1
trees
0
where
1
they
1
slept
1
well
1
until
2
the
1
morning
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
dreamed
2
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
of
1
the
1
good
1
Wizard
2
Oz
1
who
1
would
1
soon
1
send
1
her
1
back
1
to
1
her
1
own
1
home
1
again
2
Our
1
little
1
party
2
of
1
travelers
3
awakened
3
the
1
next
1
morning
2
refreshed
2
and
1
full
1
of
1
hope
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
breakfasted
3
like
1
a
1
princess
2
off
1
peaches
2
and
1
plums
1
from
1
the
1
trees
0
beside
2
the
1
river
2
Behind
2
them
1
was
1
the
1
dark
1
forest
2
they
1
had
1
passed
1
safely
3
through
1
although
2
they
1
had
1
suffered
2
many
2
discouragements
5
but
1
before
2
them
1
was
1
a
1
lovely
3
sunny
2
country
2
that
1
seemed
1
to
1
beckon
2
them
1
on
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
To
1
be
1
sure
1
the
1
broad
1
river
2
now
1
cut
1
them
1
off
1
from
1
this
1
beautiful
4
land
1
But
1
the
1
raft
1
was
1
nearly
3
done
1
and
1
after
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
had
1
cut
1
a
1
few
1
more
1
logs
1
and
1
fastened
2
them
1
together
3
with
1
wooden
2
pins
1
they
1
were
1
ready
3
to
1
start
1
Dorothy
3
sat
1
down
1
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
raft
1
and
1
held
1
Toto
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
When
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
stepped
1
upon
2
the
1
raft
1
it
1
tipped
1
badly
2
for
1
he
1
was
1
big
1
and
1
heavy
3
but
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
stood
1
upon
2
the
1
other
2
end
1
to
1
steady
3
it
1
and
1
they
1
had
1
long
1
poles
1
in
1
their
1
hands
1
to
1
push
1
the
1
raft
1
through
1
the
1
water
2
They
1
got
1
along
2
quite
1
well
1
at
1
first
1
but
1
when
1
they
1
reached
2
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
river
2
the
1
swift
1
current
2
swept
1
the
1
raft
1
downstream
3
farther
2
and
1
farther
2
away
2
from
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
And
1
the
1
water
2
grew
1
so
1
deep
1
that
1
the
1
long
1
poles
1
would
1
not
1
touch
1
the
1
bottom
2
This
1
is
1
bad
1
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
for
1
if
1
we
1
can
1
not
1
get
1
to
1
the
1
land
1
we
1
shall
1
be
1
carried
2
into
2
the
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
and
1
she
0
will
1
enchant
2
us
1
and
1
make
1
us
1
her
1
slaves
1
And
1
then
1
I
1
should
1
get
1
no
1
brains
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
And
1
I
1
should
1
get
1
no
1
courage
2
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
And
1
I
1
should
1
get
1
no
1
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
And
1
I
1
should
1
never
2
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
We
1
must
1
certainly
3
get
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
if
1
we
1
can
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
continued
2
and
1
he
1
pushed
1
so
1
hard
1
on
1
his
1
long
1
pole
1
that
1
it
1
stuck
1
fast
1
in
1
the
1
mud
1
at
1
the
1
bottom
2
of
1
the
1
river
2
Then
1
before
2
he
1
could
1
pull
1
it
1
out
1
again
2
or
1
let
1
go
1
the
1
raft
1
was
1
swept
1
away
2
and
1
the
1
poor
1
Scarecrow
3
was
1
left
1
clinging
2
to
1
the
1
pole
1
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
river
2
Good-bye
1
he
1
called
1
after
2
them
1
and
1
they
1
were
1
very
2
sorry
2
to
1
leave
2
him
1
Indeed
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
began
2
to
1
cry
1
but
1
fortunately
5
remembered
3
that
1
he
1
might
1
rust
1
and
1
so
1
dried
1
his
1
tears
2
on
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
apron
2
Of
1
course
1
this
1
was
1
a
1
bad
1
thing
1
for
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
am
1
now
1
worse
1
off
1
than
1
when
1
I
1
first
1
met
1
Dorothy
3
he
1
thought
1
Then
1
I
1
was
1
stuck
1
on
1
a
1
pole
1
in
1
a
1
cornfield
3
where
1
I
1
could
1
make-believe
5
scare
1
the
1
crows
1
at
1
any
2
rate
1
But
1
surely
3
there
1
is
1
no
1
use
1
for
1
a
1
Scarecrow
3
stuck
1
on
1
a
1
pole
1
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
a
1
river
2
I
1
am
1
afraid
2
I
1
shall
1
never
2
have
1
any
2
brains
1
after
2
all
1
Down
1
the
1
stream
2
the
1
raft
1
floated
1
and
1
the
1
poor
1
Scarecrow
3
was
1
left
1
far
1
behind
2
Then
1
the
1
Lion
1
said
1
Something
3
must
1
be
1
done
1
to
1
save
1
us
1
I
1
think
1
I
1
can
1
swim
1
to
1
the
1
shore
1
and
1
pull
1
the
1
raft
1
after
2
me
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
only
2
hold
1
fast
1
to
1
the
1
tip
1
of
1
my
1
tail
1
So
1
he
1
sprang
1
into
2
the
1
water
2
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
caught
1
fast
1
hold
1
of
1
his
1
tail
1
Then
1
the
1
Lion
1
began
2
to
1
swim
1
with
1
all
1
his
1
might
1
toward
2
the
1
shore
1
It
1
was
1
hard
1
work
1
although
2
he
1
was
1
so
1
big
1
but
1
by
1
and
1
by
1
they
1
were
1
drawn
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
current
2
and
1
then
1
Dorothy
3
took
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman's
2
long
1
pole
1
and
1
helped
1
push
1
the
1
raft
1
to
1
the
1
land
1
They
1
were
1
all
1
tired
1
out
1
when
1
they
1
reached
2
the
1
shore
1
at
1
last
1
and
1
stepped
1
off
1
upon
2
the
1
pretty
2
green
1
grass
1
and
1
they
1
also
2
knew
1
that
1
the
1
stream
2
had
1
carried
2
them
1
a
1
long
1
way
1
past
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
that
1
led
0
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
What
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
now
1
asked
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
as
1
the
1
Lion
1
lay
1
down
1
on
1
the
1
grass
1
to
1
let
1
the
1
sun
1
dry
1
him
1
We
1
must
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
in
1
some
1
way
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
The
1
best
1
plan
1
will
1
be
1
to
1
walk
1
along
2
the
1
riverbank
3
until
2
we
1
come
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
again
2
remarked
2
the
1
Lion
1
So
1
when
1
they
1
were
1
rested
1
Dorothy
3
picked
1
up
1
her
1
basket
2
and
1
they
1
started
1
along
2
the
1
grassy
2
bank
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
from
1
which
1
the
1
river
2
had
1
carried
2
them
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
lovely
3
country
2
with
1
plenty
2
of
1
flowers
2
and
1
fruit
1
trees
0
and
1
sunshine
2
to
1
cheer
1
them
1
and
1
had
1
they
1
not
1
felt
1
so
1
sorry
2
for
1
the
1
poor
1
Scarecrow
3
they
1
could
1
have
1
been
1
very
2
happy
2
They
1
walked
1
along
2
as
1
fast
1
as
1
they
1
could
1
Dorothy
3
only
2
stopping
2
once
1
to
1
pick
1
a
1
beautiful
4
flower
2
and
1
after
2
a
1
time
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
cried
1
out
1
Look
1
Then
1
they
1
all
1
looked
1
at
1
the
1
river
2
and
1
saw
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
perched
1
upon
2
his
1
pole
1
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
water
2
looking
2
very
2
lonely
3
and
1
sad
1
What
1
can
1
we
1
do
1
to
1
save
1
him
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
The
1
Lion
1
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
both
1
shook
1
their
1
heads
2
for
1
they
1
did
1
not
1
know
1
So
1
they
1
sat
1
down
1
upon
2
the
1
bank
1
and
1
gazed
1
wistfully
3
at
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
until
2
a
1
Stork
1
flew
1
by
1
who
1
upon
2
seeing
1
them
1
stopped
1
to
1
rest
1
at
1
the
1
water
2
's
0
edge
1
Who
1
are
1
you
1
and
1
where
1
are
1
you
1
going
1
asked
1
the
1
Stork
1
I
1
am
1
Dorothy
3
answered
2
the
1
girl
1
and
1
these
1
are
1
my
1
friends
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
and
1
we
1
are
1
going
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
This
1
is
1
n't
0
the
1
road
1
said
1
the
1
Stork
1
as
1
she
0
twisted
1
her
1
long
1
neck
1
and
1
looked
1
sharply
2
at
1
the
1
queer
1
party
2
I
1
know
1
it
1
returned
2
Dorothy
3
but
1
we
1
have
1
lost
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
are
1
wondering
3
how
1
we
1
shall
1
get
1
him
1
again
2
Where
1
is
1
he
1
asked
1
the
1
Stork
1
Over
2
there
1
in
1
the
1
river
2
answered
2
the
1
little
1
girl
1
If
1
he
1
was
1
n't
0
so
1
big
1
and
1
heavy
3
I
1
would
1
get
1
him
1
for
1
you
1
remarked
2
the
1
Stork
1
He
1
is
1
n't
0
heavy
3
a
1
bit
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
eagerly
4
for
1
he
1
is
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
and
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
bring
1
him
1
back
1
to
1
us
1
we
1
shall
1
thank
1
you
1
ever
2
and
1
ever
2
so
1
much
1
Well
1
I
1
'll
0
try
1
said
1
the
1
Stork
1
but
1
if
1
I
1
find
1
he
1
is
1
too
1
heavy
3
to
1
carry
2
I
1
shall
1
have
1
to
1
drop
1
him
1
in
1
the
1
river
2
again
2
So
1
the
1
big
1
bird
1
flew
1
into
2
the
1
air
1
and
1
over
2
the
1
water
2
till
1
she
0
came
1
to
1
where
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
was
1
perched
1
upon
2
his
1
pole
1
Then
1
the
1
Stork
1
with
1
her
1
great
2
claws
1
grabbed
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
by
1
the
1
arm
1
and
1
carried
2
him
1
up
1
into
2
the
1
air
1
and
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
bank
1
where
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
Toto
2
were
1
sitting
2
When
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
found
1
himself
2
among
2
his
1
friends
2
again
2
he
1
was
1
so
1
happy
2
that
1
he
1
hugged
1
them
1
all
1
even
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
Toto
2
and
1
as
1
they
1
walked
1
along
2
he
1
sang
1
Tol-de-ri-de-oh
5
at
1
every
3
step
1
he
1
felt
1
so
1
gay
1
I
1
was
1
afraid
2
I
1
should
1
have
1
to
1
stay
1
in
1
the
1
river
2
forever
3
he
1
said
1
but
1
the
1
kind
1
Stork
1
saved
1
me
1
and
1
if
1
I
1
ever
2
get
1
any
2
brains
1
I
1
shall
1
find
1
the
1
Stork
1
again
2
and
1
do
1
her
1
some
1
kindness
2
in
1
return
2
That
1
's
0
all
1
right
1
said
1
the
1
Stork
1
who
1
was
1
flying
1
along
2
beside
2
them
1
I
1
always
2
like
1
to
1
help
1
anyone
2
in
1
trouble
1
But
1
I
1
must
1
go
1
now
1
for
1
my
1
babies
2
are
1
waiting
2
in
1
the
1
nest
1
for
1
me
1
I
1
hope
1
you
1
will
1
find
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
that
1
Oz
1
will
1
help
1
you
1
Thank
1
you
1
replied
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
then
1
the
1
kind
1
Stork
1
flew
1
into
2
the
1
air
1
and
1
was
1
soon
1
out
1
of
1
sight
1
They
1
walked
1
along
2
listening
3
to
1
the
1
singing
2
of
1
the
1
brightly
2
colored
2
birds
1
and
1
looking
2
at
1
the
1
lovely
3
flowers
2
which
1
now
1
became
2
so
1
thick
1
that
1
the
1
ground
1
was
1
carpeted
2
with
1
them
1
There
1
were
1
big
1
yellow
2
and
1
white
1
and
1
blue
0
and
1
purple
1
blossoms
2
besides
2
great
2
clusters
2
of
1
scarlet
2
poppies
2
which
1
were
1
so
1
brilliant
3
in
1
color
2
they
1
almost
2
dazzled
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
eyes
0
Are
1
n't
0
they
1
beautiful
4
the
1
girl
1
asked
1
as
1
she
0
breathed
2
in
1
the
1
spicy
2
scent
1
of
1
the
1
bright
1
flowers
2
I
1
suppose
2
so
1
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
When
1
I
1
have
1
brains
1
I
1
shall
1
probably
3
like
1
them
1
better
2
If
1
I
1
only
2
had
1
a
1
heart
2
I
1
should
1
love
1
them
1
added
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
I
1
always
2
did
1
like
1
flowers
2
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
They
1
seem
1
so
1
helpless
2
and
1
frail
1
But
1
there
1
are
1
none
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
so
1
bright
1
as
1
these
1
They
1
now
1
came
1
upon
2
more
1
and
1
more
1
of
1
the
1
big
1
scarlet
2
poppies
2
and
1
fewer
2
and
1
fewer
2
of
1
the
1
other
2
flowers
2
and
1
soon
1
they
1
found
1
themselves
2
in
1
the
1
midst
1
of
1
a
1
great
2
meadow
3
of
1
poppies
2
Now
1
it
1
is
1
well
1
known
1
that
1
when
1
there
1
are
1
many
2
of
1
these
1
flowers
2
together
3
their
1
odor
2
is
1
so
1
powerful
3
that
1
anyone
2
who
1
breathes
2
it
1
falls
1
asleep
2
and
1
if
1
the
1
sleeper
2
is
1
not
1
carried
2
away
2
from
1
the
1
scent
1
of
1
the
1
flowers
2
he
1
sleeps
1
on
1
and
1
on
1
forever
3
But
1
Dorothy
3
did
1
not
1
know
1
this
1
nor
1
could
1
she
0
get
1
away
2
from
1
the
1
bright
1
red
0
flowers
2
that
1
were
1
everywhere
4
about
2
so
1
presently
3
her
1
eyes
0
grew
1
heavy
3
and
1
she
0
felt
1
she
0
must
1
sit
1
down
1
to
1
rest
1
and
1
to
1
sleep
1
But
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
would
1
not
1
let
1
her
1
do
1
this
1
We
1
must
1
hurry
2
and
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
before
2
dark
1
he
1
said
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
agreed
1
with
1
him
1
So
1
they
1
kept
1
walking
2
until
2
Dorothy
3
could
1
stand
1
no
1
longer
2
Her
1
eyes
0
closed
1
in
1
spite
1
of
1
herself
2
and
1
she
0
forgot
2
where
1
she
0
was
1
and
1
fell
1
among
2
the
1
poppies
2
fast
1
asleep
2
What
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
asked
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
If
1
we
1
leave
2
her
1
here
1
she
0
will
1
die
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
The
1
smell
1
of
1
the
1
flowers
2
is
1
killing
2
us
1
all
1
I
1
myself
2
can
1
scarcely
3
keep
1
my
1
eyes
0
open
2
and
1
the
1
dog
1
is
1
asleep
2
already
4
It
1
was
1
true
0
Toto
2
had
1
fallen
2
down
1
beside
2
his
1
little
1
mistress
2
But
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
not
1
being
1
made
1
of
1
flesh
1
were
1
not
1
troubled
1
by
1
the
1
scent
1
of
1
the
1
flowers
2
Run
1
fast
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
to
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
get
1
out
1
of
1
this
1
deadly
3
flower
2
bed
0
as
1
soon
1
as
1
you
1
can
1
We
1
will
1
bring
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
with
1
us
1
but
1
if
1
you
1
should
1
fall
1
asleep
2
you
1
are
1
too
1
big
1
to
1
be
1
carried
2
So
1
the
1
Lion
1
aroused
2
himself
2
and
1
bounded
1
forward
2
as
1
fast
1
as
1
he
1
could
1
go
1
In
1
a
1
moment
2
he
1
was
1
out
1
of
1
sight
1
Let
1
us
1
make
1
a
1
chair
1
with
1
our
1
hands
1
and
1
carry
2
her
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
So
1
they
1
picked
1
up
1
Toto
2
and
1
put
1
the
1
dog
1
in
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
lap
1
and
1
then
1
they
1
made
1
a
1
chair
1
with
1
their
1
hands
1
for
1
the
1
seat
2
and
1
their
1
arms
1
for
1
the
1
arms
1
and
1
carried
2
the
1
sleeping
2
girl
1
between
2
them
1
through
1
the
1
flowers
2
On
1
and
1
on
1
they
1
walked
1
and
1
it
1
seemed
1
that
1
the
1
great
2
carpet
2
of
1
deadly
3
flowers
2
that
1
surrounded
2
them
1
would
1
never
2
end
1
They
1
followed
2
the
1
bend
1
of
1
the
1
river
2
and
1
at
1
last
1
came
1
upon
2
their
1
friend
2
the
1
Lion
1
lying
1
fast
1
asleep
2
among
2
the
1
poppies
2
The
1
flowers
2
had
1
been
1
too
1
strong
1
for
1
the
1
huge
1
beast
2
and
1
he
1
had
1
given
2
up
1
at
1
last
1
and
1
fallen
2
only
2
a
1
short
1
distance
2
from
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
the
1
poppy
2
bed
0
where
1
the
1
sweet
1
grass
1
spread
2
in
1
beautiful
4
green
1
fields
2
before
2
them
1
We
1
can
1
do
1
nothing
2
for
1
him
1
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
sadly
2
for
1
he
1
is
1
much
1
too
1
heavy
3
to
1
lift
1
We
1
must
1
leave
2
him
1
here
1
to
1
sleep
1
on
1
forever
3
and
1
perhaps
2
he
1
will
1
dream
2
that
1
he
1
has
1
found
1
courage
2
at
1
last
1
I
1
'm
0
sorry
2
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
The
1
Lion
1
was
1
a
1
very
2
good
1
comrade
2
for
1
one
1
so
1
cowardly
3
But
1
let
1
us
1
go
1
on
1
They
1
carried
2
the
1
sleeping
2
girl
1
to
1
a
1
pretty
2
spot
1
beside
2
the
1
river
2
far
1
enough
2
from
1
the
1
poppy
2
field
2
to
1
prevent
2
her
1
breathing
3
any
2
more
1
of
1
the
1
poison
2
of
1
the
1
flowers
2
and
1
here
1
they
1
laid
1
her
1
gently
2
on
1
the
1
soft
1
grass
1
and
1
waited
1
for
1
the
1
fresh
1
breeze
1
to
1
waken
2
her
1
We
1
can
1
not
1
be
1
far
1
from
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
now
1
remarked
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
as
1
he
1
stood
1
beside
2
the
1
girl
1
for
1
we
1
have
1
come
1
nearly
3
as
1
far
1
as
1
the
1
river
2
carried
2
us
1
away
2
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
was
1
about
2
to
1
reply
2
when
1
he
1
heard
2
a
1
low
1
growl
1
and
1
turning
2
his
1
head
2
which
1
worked
1
beautifully
5
on
1
hinges
1
he
1
saw
1
a
1
strange
1
beast
2
come
1
bounding
2
over
2
the
1
grass
1
toward
2
them
1
It
1
was
1
indeed
1
a
1
great
2
yellow
2
Wildcat
2
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
thought
1
it
1
must
1
be
1
chasing
2
something
3
for
1
its
1
ears
2
were
1
lying
1
close
1
to
1
its
1
head
2
and
1
its
1
mouth
1
was
1
wide
1
open
2
showing
2
two
1
rows
1
of
1
ugly
2
teeth
1
while
1
its
1
red
0
eyes
0
glowed
1
like
1
balls
1
of
1
fire
1
As
1
it
1
came
1
nearer
3
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
saw
1
that
1
running
2
before
2
the
1
beast
2
was
1
a
1
little
1
gray
1
field
2
mouse
1
and
1
although
2
he
1
had
1
no
1
heart
2
he
1
knew
1
it
1
was
1
wrong
1
for
1
the
1
Wildcat
2
to
1
try
1
to
1
kill
1
such
1
a
1
pretty
2
harmless
2
creature
3
So
1
the
1
Woodman
2
raised
1
his
1
axe
1
and
1
as
1
the
1
Wildcat
2
ran
1
by
1
he
1
gave
1
it
1
a
1
quick
1
blow
1
that
1
cut
1
the
1
beast
2
's
0
head
2
clean
2
off
1
from
1
its
1
body
2
and
1
it
1
rolled
1
over
2
at
1
his
1
feet
1
in
1
two
1
pieces
2
The
1
field
2
mouse
1
now
1
that
1
it
1
was
1
freed
0
from
1
its
1
enemy
3
stopped
1
short
1
and
1
coming
2
slowly
2
up
1
to
1
the
1
Woodman
2
it
1
said
1
in
1
a
1
squeaky
3
little
1
voice
1
Oh
1
thank
1
you
1
Thank
1
you
1
ever
2
so
1
much
1
for
1
saving
2
my
1
life
1
Do
1
n't
0
speak
2
of
1
it
1
I
1
beg
1
of
1
you
1
replied
2
the
1
Woodman
2
I
1
have
1
no
1
heart
2
you
1
know
1
so
1
I
1
am
1
careful
3
to
1
help
1
all
1
those
1
who
1
may
1
need
0
a
1
friend
2
even
2
if
1
it
1
happens
2
to
1
be
1
only
2
a
1
mouse
1
Only
2
a
1
mouse
1
cried
1
the
1
little
1
animal
3
indignantly
4
Why
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
Queen
1
the
1
Queen
1
of
1
all
1
the
1
Field
2
Mice
1
Oh
1
indeed
1
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
making
2
a
1
bow
1
Therefore
3
you
1
have
1
done
1
a
1
great
2
deed
0
as
1
well
1
as
1
a
1
brave
1
one
1
in
1
saving
2
my
1
life
1
added
1
the
1
Queen
1
At
1
that
1
moment
2
several
3
mice
1
were
1
seen
1
running
2
up
1
as
1
fast
1
as
1
their
1
little
1
legs
1
could
1
carry
2
them
1
and
1
when
1
they
1
saw
1
their
1
Queen
1
they
1
exclaimed
2
Oh
1
your
1
Majesty
3
we
1
thought
1
you
1
would
1
be
1
killed
1
How
1
did
1
you
1
manage
2
to
1
escape
2
the
1
great
2
Wildcat
2
They
1
all
1
bowed
1
so
1
low
1
to
1
the
1
little
1
Queen
1
that
1
they
1
almost
2
stood
1
upon
2
their
1
heads
2
This
1
funny
2
tin
1
man
1
she
0
answered
2
killed
1
the
1
Wildcat
2
and
1
saved
1
my
1
life
1
So
1
hereafter
4
you
1
must
1
all
1
serve
1
him
1
and
1
obey
2
his
1
slightest
2
wish
1
We
1
will
1
cried
1
all
1
the
1
mice
1
in
1
a
1
shrill
1
chorus
2
And
1
then
1
they
1
scampered
2
in
1
all
1
directions
3
for
1
Toto
2
had
1
awakened
3
from
1
his
1
sleep
1
and
1
seeing
1
all
1
these
1
mice
1
around
2
him
1
he
1
gave
1
one
1
bark
1
of
1
delight
2
and
1
jumped
1
right
1
into
2
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
group
1
Toto
2
had
1
always
2
loved
1
to
1
chase
1
mice
1
when
1
he
1
lived
1
in
1
Kansas
2
and
1
he
1
saw
1
no
1
harm
1
in
1
it
1
But
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
caught
1
the
1
dog
1
in
1
his
1
arms
1
and
1
held
1
him
1
tight
1
while
1
he
1
called
1
to
1
the
1
mice
1
Come
1
back
1
Come
1
back
1
Toto
2
shall
1
not
1
hurt
1
you
1
At
1
this
1
the
1
Queen
1
of
1
the
1
Mice
1
stuck
1
her
1
head
2
out
1
from
1
underneath
4
a
1
clump
1
of
1
grass
1
and
1
asked
1
in
1
a
1
timid
2
voice
1
Are
1
you
1
sure
1
he
1
will
1
not
1
bite
1
us
1
I
1
will
1
not
1
let
1
him
1
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
so
1
do
1
not
1
be
1
afraid
2
One
1
by
1
one
1
the
1
mice
1
came
1
creeping
2
back
1
and
1
Toto
2
did
1
not
1
bark
1
again
2
although
2
he
1
tried
1
to
1
get
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
Woodman
2
's
0
arms
1
and
1
would
1
have
1
bitten
2
him
1
had
1
he
1
not
1
known
1
very
2
well
1
he
1
was
1
made
1
of
1
tin
1
Finally
3
one
1
of
1
the
1
biggest
2
mice
1
spoke
1
Is
1
there
1
anything
3
we
1
can
1
do
1
it
1
asked
1
to
1
repay
2
you
1
for
1
saving
2
the
1
life
1
of
1
our
1
Queen
1
Nothing
2
that
1
I
1
know
1
of
1
answered
2
the
1
Woodman
2
but
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
who
1
had
1
been
1
trying
1
to
1
think
1
but
1
could
1
not
1
because
2
his
1
head
2
was
1
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
said
1
quickly
2
Oh
1
yes
0
you
1
can
1
save
1
our
1
friend
2
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
who
1
is
1
asleep
2
in
1
the
1
poppy
2
bed
0
A
1
Lion
1
cried
1
the
1
little
1
Queen
1
Why
1
he
1
would
1
eat
2
us
1
all
1
up
1
Oh
1
no
1
declared
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
this
1
Lion
1
is
1
a
1
coward
2
Really
3
asked
1
the
1
Mouse
1
He
1
says
1
so
1
himself
2
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
he
1
would
1
never
2
hurt
1
anyone
2
who
1
is
1
our
1
friend
2
If
1
you
1
will
1
help
1
us
1
to
1
save
1
him
1
I
1
promise
2
that
1
he
1
shall
1
treat
2
you
1
all
1
with
1
kindness
2
Very
2
well
1
said
1
the
1
Queen
1
we
1
trust
1
you
1
But
1
what
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
Are
1
there
1
many
2
of
1
these
1
mice
1
which
1
call
1
you
1
Queen
1
and
1
are
1
willing
2
to
1
obey
2
you
1
Oh
1
yes
0
there
1
are
1
thousands
2
she
0
replied
2
Then
1
send
1
for
1
them
1
all
1
to
1
come
1
here
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
possible
2
and
1
let
1
each
2
one
1
bring
1
a
1
long
1
piece
2
of
1
string
1
The
1
Queen
1
turned
1
to
1
the
1
mice
1
that
1
attended
2
her
1
and
1
told
1
them
1
to
1
go
1
at
1
once
1
and
1
get
1
all
1
her
1
people
1
As
1
soon
1
as
1
they
1
heard
2
her
1
orders
2
they
1
ran
1
away
2
in
1
every
3
direction
3
as
1
fast
1
as
1
possible
2
Now
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
to
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
you
1
must
1
go
1
to
1
those
1
trees
0
by
1
the
1
riverside
3
and
1
make
1
a
1
truck
1
that
1
will
1
carry
2
the
1
Lion
1
So
1
the
1
Woodman
2
went
1
at
1
once
1
to
1
the
1
trees
0
and
1
began
2
to
1
work
1
and
1
he
1
soon
1
made
1
a
1
truck
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
limbs
1
of
1
trees
0
from
1
which
1
he
1
chopped
1
away
2
all
1
the
1
leaves
2
and
1
branches
1
He
1
fastened
2
it
1
together
3
with
1
wooden
2
pegs
1
and
1
made
1
the
1
four
1
wheels
1
out
1
of
1
short
1
pieces
2
of
1
a
1
big
1
tree
1
trunk
1
So
1
fast
1
and
1
so
1
well
1
did
1
he
1
work
1
that
1
by
1
the
1
time
1
the
1
mice
1
began
2
to
1
arrive
2
the
1
truck
1
was
1
all
1
ready
3
for
1
them
1
They
1
came
1
from
1
all
1
directions
3
and
1
there
1
were
1
thousands
2
of
1
them
1
big
1
mice
1
and
1
little
1
mice
1
and
1
middle-sized
3
mice
1
and
1
each
2
one
1
brought
1
a
1
piece
2
of
1
string
1
in
1
his
1
mouth
1
It
1
was
1
about
2
this
1
time
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
woke
1
from
1
her
1
long
1
sleep
1
and
1
opened
2
her
1
eyes
0
She
0
was
1
greatly
3
astonished
3
to
1
find
1
herself
2
lying
1
upon
2
the
1
grass
1
with
1
thousands
2
of
1
mice
1
standing
2
around
2
and
1
looking
2
at
1
her
1
timidly
3
But
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
told
1
her
1
about
2
everything
4
and
1
turning
2
to
1
the
1
dignified
3
little
1
Mouse
1
he
1
said
1
Permit
2
me
1
to
1
introduce
3
to
1
you
1
her
1
Majesty
3
the
1
Queen
1
Dorothy
3
nodded
1
gravely
3
and
1
the
1
Queen
1
made
1
a
1
curtsy
2
after
2
which
1
she
0
became
2
quite
1
friendly
3
with
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
now
1
began
2
to
1
fasten
2
the
1
mice
1
to
1
the
1
truck
1
using
2
the
1
strings
1
they
1
had
1
brought
1
One
1
end
1
of
1
a
1
string
1
was
1
tied
1
around
2
the
1
neck
1
of
1
each
2
mouse
1
and
1
the
1
other
2
end
1
to
1
the
1
truck
1
Of
1
course
1
the
1
truck
1
was
1
a
1
thousand
2
times
1
bigger
2
than
1
any
2
of
1
the
1
mice
1
who
1
were
1
to
1
draw
1
it
1
but
1
when
1
all
1
the
1
mice
1
had
1
been
1
harnessed
2
they
1
were
1
able
1
to
1
pull
1
it
1
quite
1
easily
4
Even
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
could
1
sit
1
on
1
it
1
and
1
were
1
drawn
1
swiftly
2
by
1
their
1
queer
1
little
1
horses
1
to
1
the
1
place
1
where
1
the
1
Lion
1
lay
1
asleep
2
After
2
a
1
great
2
deal
2
of
1
hard
1
work
1
for
1
the
1
Lion
1
was
1
heavy
3
they
1
managed
2
to
1
get
1
him
1
up
1
on
1
the
1
truck
1
Then
1
the
1
Queen
1
hurriedly
4
gave
1
her
1
people
1
the
1
order
2
to
1
start
1
for
1
she
0
feared
2
if
1
the
1
mice
1
stayed
0
among
2
the
1
poppies
2
too
1
long
1
they
1
also
2
would
1
fall
1
asleep
2
At
1
first
1
the
1
little
1
creatures
3
many
2
though
1
they
1
were
1
could
1
hardly
2
stir
1
the
1
heavily
4
loaded
1
truck
1
but
1
the
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
both
1
pushed
1
from
1
behind
2
and
1
they
1
got
1
along
2
better
2
Soon
1
they
1
rolled
1
the
1
Lion
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
poppy
2
bed
0
to
1
the
1
green
1
fields
2
where
1
he
1
could
1
breathe
2
the
1
sweet
1
fresh
1
air
1
again
2
instead
3
of
1
the
1
poisonous
3
scent
1
of
1
the
1
flowers
2
Dorothy
3
came
1
to
1
meet
1
them
1
and
1
thanked
1
the
1
little
1
mice
1
warmly
2
for
1
saving
2
her
1
companion
3
from
1
death
2
She
0
had
1
grown
1
so
1
fond
1
of
1
the
1
big
1
Lion
1
she
0
was
1
glad
1
he
1
had
1
been
1
rescued
1
Then
1
the
1
mice
1
were
1
unharnessed
3
from
1
the
1
truck
1
and
1
scampered
2
away
2
through
1
the
1
grass
1
to
1
their
1
homes
1
The
1
Queen
1
of
1
the
1
Mice
1
was
1
the
1
last
1
to
1
leave
2
If
1
ever
2
you
1
need
0
us
1
again
2
she
0
said
1
come
1
out
1
into
2
the
1
field
2
and
1
call
1
and
1
we
1
shall
1
hear
2
you
1
and
1
come
1
to
1
your
1
assistance
3
Good-bye
1
Good-bye
1
they
1
all
1
answered
2
and
1
away
2
the
1
Queen
1
ran
1
while
1
Dorothy
3
held
1
Toto
2
tightly
2
lest
1
he
1
should
1
run
1
after
2
her
1
and
1
frighten
2
her
1
After
2
this
1
they
1
sat
1
down
1
beside
2
the
1
Lion
1
until
2
he
1
should
1
awaken
3
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
brought
1
Dorothy
3
some
1
fruit
1
from
1
a
1
tree
1
near
2
by
1
which
1
she
0
ate
1
for
1
her
1
dinner
2
It
1
was
1
some
1
time
1
before
2
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
awakened
3
for
1
he
1
had
1
lain
1
among
2
the
1
poppies
2
a
1
long
1
while
1
breathing
3
in
1
their
1
deadly
3
fragrance
2
but
1
when
1
he
1
did
1
open
2
his
1
eyes
0
and
1
roll
1
off
1
the
1
truck
1
he
1
was
1
very
2
glad
1
to
1
find
1
himself
2
still
1
alive
2
I
1
ran
1
as
1
fast
1
as
1
I
1
could
1
he
1
said
1
sitting
2
down
1
and
1
yawning
3
but
1
the
1
flowers
2
were
1
too
1
strong
1
for
1
me
1
How
1
did
1
you
1
get
1
me
1
out
1
Then
1
they
1
told
1
him
1
of
1
the
1
field
2
mice
1
and
1
how
1
they
1
had
1
generously
4
saved
1
him
1
from
1
death
2
and
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
laughed
1
and
1
said
1
I
1
have
1
always
2
thought
1
myself
2
very
2
big
1
and
1
terrible
2
yet
1
such
1
little
1
things
1
as
1
flowers
2
came
1
near
2
to
1
killing
2
me
1
and
1
such
1
small
1
animals
3
as
1
mice
1
have
1
saved
1
my
1
life
1
How
1
strange
1
it
1
all
1
is
1
But
1
comrades
2
what
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
now
1
We
1
must
1
journey
2
on
1
until
2
we
1
find
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
again
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
then
1
we
1
can
1
keep
1
on
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
So
1
the
1
Lion
1
being
1
fully
2
refreshed
2
and
1
feeling
2
quite
1
himself
2
again
2
they
1
all
1
started
1
upon
2
the
1
journey
2
greatly
3
enjoying
2
the
1
walk
1
through
1
the
1
soft
1
fresh
1
grass
1
and
1
it
1
was
1
not
1
long
1
before
2
they
1
reached
2
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
and
1
turned
1
again
2
toward
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
where
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
dwelt
1
The
1
road
1
was
1
smooth
1
and
1
well
1
paved
1
now
1
and
1
the
1
country
2
about
2
was
1
beautiful
4
so
1
that
1
the
1
travelers
3
rejoiced
2
in
1
leaving
3
the
1
forest
2
far
1
behind
2
and
1
with
1
it
1
the
1
many
2
dangers
2
they
1
had
1
met
1
in
1
its
1
gloomy
2
shades
1
Once
1
more
1
they
1
could
1
see
1
fences
1
built
1
beside
2
the
1
road
1
but
1
these
1
were
1
painted
1
green
1
and
1
when
1
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
small
1
house
1
in
1
which
1
a
1
farmer
2
evidently
4
lived
1
that
1
also
2
was
1
painted
1
green
1
They
1
passed
1
by
1
several
3
of
1
these
1
houses
1
during
2
the
1
afternoon
3
and
1
sometimes
3
people
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
doors
1
and
1
looked
1
at
1
them
1
as
1
if
1
they
1
would
1
like
1
to
1
ask
1
questions
2
but
1
no
1
one
1
came
1
near
2
them
1
nor
1
spoke
1
to
1
them
1
because
2
of
1
the
1
great
2
Lion
1
of
1
which
1
they
1
were
1
very
2
much
1
afraid
2
The
1
people
1
were
1
all
1
dressed
1
in
1
clothing
2
of
1
a
1
lovely
3
emerald-green
4
color
2
and
1
wore
1
peaked
2
hats
1
like
1
those
1
of
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
This
1
must
1
be
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
we
1
are
1
surely
3
getting
2
near
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
Yes
0
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Everything
4
is
1
green
1
here
1
while
1
in
1
the
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
blue
0
was
1
the
1
favorite
3
color
2
But
1
the
1
people
1
do
1
not
1
seem
1
to
1
be
1
as
1
friendly
3
as
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
and
1
I
1
'm
0
afraid
2
we
1
shall
1
be
1
unable
2
to
1
find
1
a
1
place
1
to
1
pass
1
the
1
night
1
I
1
should
1
like
1
something
3
to
1
eat
2
besides
2
fruit
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
and
1
I'm
1
sure
1
Toto
2
is
1
nearly
3
starved
1
Let
1
us
1
stop
1
at
1
the
1
next
1
house
1
and
1
talk
1
to
1
the
1
people
1
So
1
when
1
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
good-sized
2
farmhouse
2
Dorothy
3
walked
1
boldly
2
up
1
to
1
the
1
door
1
and
1
knocked
1
A
1
woman
2
opened
2
it
1
just
1
far
1
enough
2
to
1
look
1
out
1
and
1
said
1
What
1
do
1
you
1
want
1
child
1
and
1
why
1
is
1
that
1
great
2
Lion
1
with
1
you
1
We
1
wish
1
to
1
pass
1
the
1
night
1
with
1
you
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
allow
2
us
1
answered
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
is
1
my
1
friend
2
and
1
comrade
2
and
1
would
1
not
1
hurt
1
you
1
for
1
the
1
world
1
Is
1
he
1
tame
1
asked
1
the
1
woman
2
opening
3
the
1
door
1
a
1
little
1
wider
2
Oh
1
yes
0
said
1
the
1
girl
1
and
1
he
1
is
1
a
1
great
2
coward
2
too
1
He
1
will
1
be
1
more
1
afraid
2
of
1
you
1
than
1
you
1
are
1
of
1
him
1
Well
1
said
1
the
1
woman
2
after
2
thinking
2
it
1
over
2
and
1
taking
2
another
3
peep
1
at
1
the
1
Lion
1
if
1
that
1
is
1
the
1
case
1
you
1
may
1
come
1
in
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
give
1
you
1
some
1
supper
2
and
1
a
1
place
1
to
1
sleep
1
So
1
they
1
all
1
entered
2
the
1
house
1
where
1
there
1
were
1
besides
2
the
1
woman
2
two
1
children
2
and
1
a
1
man
1
The
1
man
1
had
1
hurt
1
his
1
leg
1
and
1
was
1
lying
1
on
1
the
1
couch
1
in
1
a
1
corner
2
They
1
seemed
1
greatly
3
surprised
2
to
1
see
1
so
1
strange
1
a
1
company
3
and
1
while
1
the
1
woman
2
was
1
busy
2
laying
1
the
1
table
1
the
1
man
1
asked
1
Where
1
are
1
you
1
all
1
going
1
To
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
see
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
Oh
1
indeed
1
exclaimed
2
the
1
man
1
Are
1
you
1
sure
1
that
1
Oz
1
will
1
see
1
you
1
Why
1
not
1
she
0
replied
2
Why
1
it
1
is
1
said
1
that
1
he
1
never
2
lets
1
anyone
2
come
1
into
2
his
1
presence
2
I
1
have
1
been
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
many
2
times
1
and
1
it
1
is
1
a
1
beautiful
4
and
1
wonderful
3
place
1
but
1
I
1
have
1
never
2
been
1
permitted
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
nor
1
do
1
I
1
know
1
of
1
any
2
living
2
person
2
who
1
has
1
seen
1
him
1
Does
0
he
1
never
2
go
1
out
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Never
2
He
1
sits
1
day
1
after
2
day
1
in
1
the
1
great
2
Throne
1
Room
1
of
1
his
1
Palace
2
and
1
even
2
those
1
who
1
wait
1
upon
2
him
1
do
1
not
1
see
1
him
1
face
1
to
1
face
1
What
1
is
1
he
1
like
1
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
That
1
is
1
hard
1
to
1
tell
1
said
1
the
1
man
1
thoughtfully
3
You
1
see
1
Oz
1
is
1
a
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
and
1
can
1
take
1
on
1
any
2
form
1
he
1
wishes
1
So
1
that
1
some
1
say
1
he
1
looks
1
like
1
a
1
bird
1
and
1
some
1
say
1
he
1
looks
1
like
1
an
1
elephant
3
and
1
some
1
say
1
he
1
looks
1
like
1
a
1
cat
1
To
1
others
2
he
1
appears
3
as
1
a
1
beautiful
4
fairy
2
or
1
a
1
brownie
2
or
1
in
1
any
2
other
2
form
1
that
1
pleases
2
him
1
But
1
who
1
the
1
real
2
Oz
1
is
1
when
1
he
1
is
1
in
1
his
1
own
1
form
1
no
1
living
2
person
2
can
1
tell
1
That
1
is
1
very
2
strange
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
but
1
we
1
must
1
try
1
in
1
some
1
way
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
or
1
we
1
shall
1
have
1
made
1
our
1
journey
2
for
1
nothing
2
Why
1
do
1
you
1
wish
1
to
1
see
1
the
1
terrible
2
Oz
1
asked
1
the
1
man
1
I
1
want
1
him
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
some
1
brains
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
eagerly
4
Oh
1
Oz
1
could
1
do
1
that
1
easily
4
enough
2
declared
2
the
1
man
1
He
1
has
1
more
1
brains
1
than
1
he
1
needs
1
And
1
I
1
want
1
him
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
That
1
will
1
not
1
trouble
1
him
1
continued
2
the
1
man
1
for
1
Oz
1
has
1
a
1
large
1
collection
3
of
1
hearts
2
of
1
all
1
sizes
1
and
1
shapes
1
And
1
I
1
want
1
him
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
courage
2
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
Oz
1
keeps
1
a
1
great
2
pot
1
of
1
courage
2
in
1
his
1
Throne
1
Room
1
said
1
the
1
man
1
which
1
he
1
has
1
covered
2
with
1
a
1
golden
2
plate
1
to
1
keep
1
it
1
from
1
running
2

He
1
will
1
be
1
glad
1
to
1
give
1
you
1
some
1
And
1
I
1
want
1
him
1
to
1
send
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
Where
1
is
1
Kansas
2
asked
1
the
1
man
1
with
1
surprise
2
I
1
do
1
n't
0
know
1
replied
2
Dorothy
3
sorrowfully
4
but
1
it
1
is
1
my
1
home
1
and
1
I
1
'm
0
sure
1
it
1
's
0
somewhere
3
Very
2
likely
3
Well
1
Oz
1
can
1
do
1
anything
3
so
1
I
1
suppose
2
he
1
will
1
find
1
Kansas
2
for
1
you
1
But
1
first
1
you
1
must
1
get
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
and
1
that
1
will
1
be
1
a
1
hard
1
task
1
for
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
does
0
not
1
like
1
to
1
see
1
anyone
2
and
1
he
1
usually
3
has
1
his
1
own
1
way
1
But
1
what
1
do
1
YOU
1
want
1
he
1
continued
2
speaking
3
to
1
Toto
2
Toto
2
only
2
wagged
1
his
1
tail
1
for
1
strange
1
to
1
say
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
speak
2
The
1
woman
2
now
1
called
1
to
1
them
1
that
1
supper
2
was
1
ready
3
so
1
they
1
gathered
2
around
2
the
1
table
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
ate
1
some
1
delicious
3
porridge
2
and
1
a
1
dish
1
of
1
scrambled
1
eggs
1
and
1
a
1
plate
1
of
1
nice
1
white
1
bread
2
and
1
enjoyed
1
her
1
meal
2
The
1
Lion
1
ate
1
some
1
of
1
the
1
porridge
2
but
1
did
1
not
1
care
1
for
1
it
1
saying
1
it
1
was
1
made
1
from
1
oats
1
and
1
oats
1
were
1
food
1
for
1
horses
1
not
1
for
1
lions
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
ate
1
nothing
2
at
1
all
1
Toto
2
ate
1
a
1
little
1
of
1
everything
4
and
1
was
1
glad
1
to
1
get
1
a
1
good
1
supper
2
again
2
The
1
woman
2
now
1
gave
1
Dorothy
3
a
1
bed
0
to
1
sleep
1
in
1
and
1
Toto
2
lay
1
down
1
beside
2
her
1
while
1
the
1
Lion
1
guarded
1
the
1
door
1
of
1
her
1
room
1
so
1
she
0
might
1
not
1
be
1
disturbed
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
stood
1
up
1
in
1
a
1
corner
2
and
1
kept
1
quiet
2
all
1
night
1
although
2
of
1
course
1
they
1
could
1
not
1
sleep
1
The
1
next
1
morning
2
as
1
soon
1
as
1
the
1
sun
1
was
1
up
1
they
1
started
1
on
1
their
1
way
1
and
1
soon
1
saw
1
a
1
beautiful
4
green
1
glow
1
in
1
the
1
sky
1
just
1
before
2
them
1
That
1
must
1
be
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
As
1
they
1
walked
1
on
1
the
1
green
1
glow
1
became
2
brighter
2
and
1
brighter
2
and
1
it
1
seemed
1
that
1
at
1
last
1
they
1
were
1
nearing
3
the
1
end
1
of
1
their
1
travels
2
Yet
1
it
1
was
1
afternoon
3
before
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
great
2
wall
1
that
1
surrounded
2
the
1
City
2
It
1
was
1
high
1
and
1
thick
1
and
1
of
1
a
1
bright
1
green
1
color
2
In
1
front
1
of
1
them
1
and
1
at
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
the
1
road
1
of
1
yellow
2
brick
1
was
1
a
1
big
1
gate
1
all
1
studded
1
with
1
emeralds
3
that
1
glittered
2
so
1
in
1
the
1
sun
1
that
1
even
2
the
1
painted
1
eyes
0
of
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
were
1
dazzled
1
by
1
their
1
brilliancy
4
There
1
was
1
a
1
bell
1
beside
2
the
1
gate
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
pushed
1
the
1
button
2
and
1
heard
2
a
1
silvery
3
tinkle
1
sound
1
within
2
Then
1
the
1
big
1
gate
1
swung
1
slowly
2
open
2
and
1
they
1
all
1
passed
1
through
1
and
1
found
1
themselves
2
in
1
a
1
high
1
arched
1
room
1
the
1
walls
1
of
1
which
1
glistened
2
with
1
countless
2
emeralds
3
Before
2
them
1
stood
1
a
1
little
1
man
1
about
2
the
1
same
1
size
1
as
1
the
1
Munchkins
2
He
1
was
1
clothed
1
all
1
in
1
green
1
from
1
his
1
head
2
to
1
his
1
feet
1
and
1
even
2
his
1
skin
1
was
1
of
1
a
1
greenish
2
tint
1
At
1
his
1
side
1
was
1
a
1
large
1
green
1
box
1
When
1
he
1
saw
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
companions
3
the
1
man
1
asked
1
What
1
do
1
you
1
wish
1
in
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
We
1
came
1
here
1
to
1
see
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
The
1
man
1
was
1
so
1
surprised
2
at
1
this
1
answer
2
that
1
he
1
sat
1
down
1
to
1
think
1
it
1
over
2
It
1
has
1
been
1
many
2
years
2
since
1
anyone
2
asked
1
me
1
to
1
see
1
Oz
1
he
1
said
1
shaking
2
his
1
head
2
in
1
perplexity
4
He
1
is
1
powerful
3
and
1
terrible
2
and
1
if
1
you
1
come
1
on
1
an
1
idle
1
or
1
foolish
2
errand
2
to
1
bother
2
the
1
wise
1
reflections
3
of
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
he
1
might
1
be
1
angry
2
and
1
destroy
2
you
1
all
1
in
1
an
1
instant
2
But
1
it
1
is
1
not
1
a
1
foolish
2
errand
2
nor
1
an
1
idle
1
one
1
replied
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
it
1
is
1
important
3
And
1
we
1
have
1
been
1
told
1
that
1
Oz
1
is
1
a
1
good
1
Wizard
2
So
1
he
1
is
1
said
1
the
1
green
1
man
1
and
1
he
1
rules
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
wisely
3
and
1
well
1
But
1
to
1
those
1
who
1
are
1
not
1
honest
2
or
1
who
1
approach
2
him
1
from
1
curiosity
4
he
1
is
1
most
1
terrible
2
and
1
few
1
have
1
ever
2
dared
1
ask
1
to
1
see
1
his
1
face
1
I
1
am
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
and
1
since
1
you
1
demand
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
I
1
must
1
take
1
you
1
to
1
his
1
Palace
2
But
1
first
1
you
1
must
1
put
1
on
1
the
1
spectacles
2
Why
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
Because
2
if
1
you
1
did
1
not
1
wear
2
spectacles
2
the
1
brightness
2
and
1
glory
2
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
would
1
blind
1
you
1
Even
2
those
1
who
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
City
2
must
1
wear
2
spectacles
2
night
1
and
1
day
1
They
1
are
1
all
1
locked
1
on
1
for
1
Oz
1
so
1
ordered
2
it
1
when
1
the
1
City
2
was
1
first
1
built
1
and
1
I
1
have
1
the
1
only
2
key
1
that
1
will
1
unlock
2
them
1
He
1
opened
2
the
1
big
1
box
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
saw
1
that
1
it
1
was
1
filled
1
with
1
spectacles
2
of
1
every
3
size
1
and
1
shape
1
All
1
of
1
them
1
had
1
green
1
glasses
1
in
1
them
1
The
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
found
1
a
1
pair
1
that
1
would
1
just
1
fit
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
put
1
them
1
over
2
her
1
eyes
0
There
1
were
1
two
1
golden
2
bands
1
fastened
2
to
1
them
1
that
1
passed
1
around
2
the
1
back
1
of
1
her
1
head
2
where
1
they
1
were
1
locked
1
together
3
by
1
a
1
little
1
key
1
that
1
was
1
at
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
a
1
chain
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
wore
1
around
2
his
1
neck
1
When
1
they
1
were
1
on
1
Dorothy
3
could
1
not
1
take
1
them
1
off
1
had
1
she
0
wished
1
but
1
of
1
course
1
she
0
did
1
not
1
wish
1
to
1
be
1
blinded
1
by
1
the
1
glare
1
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
so
1
she
0
said
1
nothing
2
Then
1
the
1
green
1
man
1
fitted
1
spectacles
2
for
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
even
2
on
1
little
1
Toto
2
and
1
all
1
were
1
locked
1
fast
1
with
1
the
1
key
1
Then
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
put
1
on
1
his
1
own
1
glasses
1
and
1
told
1
them
1
he
1
was
1
ready
3
to
1
show
1
them
1
to
1
the
1
Palace
2
Taking
2
a
1
big
1
golden
2
key
1
from
1
a
1
peg
1
on
1
the
1
wall
1
he
1
opened
2
another
3
gate
1
and
1
they
1
all
1
followed
2
him
1
through
1
the
1
portal
2
into
2
the
1
streets
1
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
Even
2
with
1
eyes
0
protected
2
by
1
the
1
green
1
spectacles
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
friends
2
were
1
at
1
first
1
dazzled
1
by
1
the
1
brilliancy
4
of
1
the
1
wonderful
3
City
2
The
1
streets
1
were
1
lined
1
with
1
beautiful
4
houses
1
all
1
built
1
of
1
green
1
marble
1
and
1
studded
1
everywhere
4
with
1
sparkling
2
emeralds
3
They
1
walked
1
over
2
a
1
pavement
3
of
1
the
1
same
1
green
1
marble
1
and
1
where
1
the
1
blocks
1
were
1
joined
1
together
3
were
1
rows
1
of
1
emeralds
3
set
1
closely
3
and
1
glittering
3
in
1
the
1
brightness
2
of
1
the
1
sun
1
The
1
window
2
panes
1
were
1
of
1
green
1
glass
1
even
2
the
1
sky
1
above
2
the
1
City
2
had
1
a
1
green
1
tint
1
and
1
the
1
rays
1
of
1
the
1
sun
1
were
1
green
1
There
1
were
1
many
2
people
1
men
1
women
2
and
1
children
2
walking
2
about
2
and
1
these
1
were
1
all
1
dressed
1
in
1
green
1
clothes
1
and
1
had
1
greenish
2
skins
1
They
1
looked
1
at
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
strangely
3
assorted
2
company
3
with
1
wondering
3
eyes
0
and
1
the
1
children
2
all
1
ran
1
away
2
and
1
hid
1
behind
2
their
1
mothers
2
when
1
they
1
saw
1
the
1
Lion
1
but
1
no
1
one
1
spoke
1
to
1
them
1
Many
2
shops
1
stood
1
in
1
the
1
street
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
saw
1
that
1
everything
4
in
1
them
1
was
1
green
1
Green
1
candy
2
and
1
green
1
pop
1
corn
1
were
1
offered
2
for
1
sale
1
as
1
well
1
as
1
green
1
shoes
0
green
1
hats
1
and
1
green
1
clothes
1
of
1
all
1
sorts
1
At
1
one
1
place
1
a
1
man
1
was
1
selling
2
green
1
lemonade
3
and
1
when
1
the
1
children
2
bought
1
it
1
Dorothy
3
could
1
see
1
that
1
they
1
paid
1
for
1
it
1
with
1
green
1
pennies
2
There
1
seemed
1
to
1
be
1
no
1
horses
1
nor
1
animals
3
of
1
any
2
kind
1
the
1
men
1
carried
2
things
1
around
2
in
1
little
1
green
1
carts
1
which
1
they
1
pushed
1
before
2
them
1
Everyone
3
seemed
1
happy
2
and
1
contented
2
and
1
prosperous
3
The
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
led
0
them
1
through
1
the
1
streets
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
big
1
building
2
exactly
3
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
City
2
which
1
was
1
the
1
Palace
2
of
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
There
1
was
1
a
1
soldier
3
before
2
the
1
door
1
dressed
1
in
1
a
1
green
1
uniform
3
and
1
wearing
3
a
1
long
1
green
1
beard
2
Here
1
are
1
strangers
2
said
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
to
1
him
1
and
1
they
1
demand
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
Step
1
inside
2
answered
2
the
1
soldier
3
and
1
I
1
will
1
carry
2
your
1
message
2
to
1
him
1
So
1
they
1
passed
1
through
1
the
1
Palace
2
Gates
1
and
1
were
1
led
0
into
2
a
1
big
1
room
1
with
1
a
1
green
1
carpet
2
and
1
lovely
3
green
1
furniture
3
set
1
with
1
emeralds
3
The
1
soldier
3
made
1
them
1
all
1
wipe
1
their
1
feet
1
upon
2
a
1
green
1
mat
1
before
2
entering
3
this
1
room
1
and
1
when
1
they
1
were
1
seated
2
he
1
said
1
politely
4
Please
2
make
1
yourselves
2
comfortable
3
while
1
I
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
door
1
of
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
tell
1
Oz
1
you
1
are
1
here
1
They
1
had
1
to
1
wait
1
a
1
long
1
time
1
before
2
the
1
soldier
3
returned
2
When
1
at
1
last
1
he
1
came
1
back
1
Dorothy
3
asked
1
Have
1
you
1
seen
1
Oz
1
Oh
1
no
1
returned
2
the
1
soldier
3
I
1
have
1
never
2
seen
1
him
1
But
1
I
1
spoke
1
to
1
him
1
as
1
he
1
sat
1
behind
2
his
1
screen
1
and
1
gave
1
him
1
your
1
message
2
He
1
said
1
he
1
will
1
grant
1
you
1
an
1
audience
3
if
1
you
1
so
1
desire
2
but
1
each
2
one
1
of
1
you
1
must
1
enter
2
his
1
presence
2
alone
2
and
1
he
1
will
1
admit
2
but
1
one
1
each
2
day
1
Therefore
3
as
1
you
1
must
1
remain
2
in
1
the
1
Palace
2
for
1
several
3
days
1
I
1
will
1
have
1
you
1
shown
1
to
1
rooms
1
where
1
you
1
may
1
rest
1
in
1
comfort
2
after
2
your
1
journey
2
Thank
1
you
1
replied
2
the
1
girl
1
that
1
is
1
very
2
kind
1
of
1
Oz
1
The
1
soldier
3
now
1
blew
1
upon
2
a
1
green
1
whistle
1
and
1
at
1
once
1
a
1
young
1
girl
1
dressed
1
in
1
a
1
pretty
2
green
1
silk
1
gown
1
entered
2
the
1
room
1
She
0
had
1
lovely
3
green
1
hair
1
and
1
green
1
eyes
0
and
1
she
0
bowed
1
low
1
before
2
Dorothy
3
as
1
she
0
said
1
Follow
2
me
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
show
1
you
1
your
1
room
1
So
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
good-bye
1
to
1
all
1
her
1
friends
2
except
2
Toto
2
and
1
taking
2
the
1
dog
1
in
1
her
1
arms
1
followed
2
the
1
green
1
girl
1
through
1
seven
2
passages
2
and
1
up
1
three
1
flights
1
of
1
stairs
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
room
1
at
1
the
1
front
1
of
1
the
1
Palace
2
It
1
was
1
the
1
sweetest
2
little
1
room
1
in
1
the
1
world
1
with
1
a
1
soft
1
comfortable
3
bed
0
that
1
had
1
sheets
1
of
1
green
1
silk
1
and
1
a
1
green
1
velvet
2
counterpane
3
There
1
was
1
a
1
tiny
2
fountain
2
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
room
1
that
1
shot
1
a
1
spray
1
of
1
green
1
perfume
2
into
2
the
1
air
1
to
1
fall
1
back
1
into
2
a
1
beautifully
5
carved
1
green
1
marble
1
basin
2
Beautiful
4
green
1
flowers
2
stood
1
in
1
the
1
windows
2
and
1
there
1
was
1
a
1
shelf
1
with
1
a
1
row
1
of
1
little
1
green
1
books
1
When
1
Dorothy
3
had
1
time
1
to
1
open
2
these
1
books
1
she
0
found
1
them
1
full
1
of
1
queer
1
green
1
pictures
2
that
1
made
1
her
1
laugh
1
they
1
were
1
so
1
funny
2
In
1
a
1
wardrobe
2
were
1
many
2
green
1
dresses
1
made
1
of
1
silk
1
and
1
satin
2
and
1
velvet
2
and
1
all
1
of
1
them
1
fitted
1
Dorothy
3
exactly
3
Make
1
yourself
2
perfectly
3
at
1
home
1
said
1
the
1
green
1
girl
1
and
1
if
1
you
1
wish
1
for
1
anything
3
ring
1
the
1
bell
1
Oz
1
will
1
send
1
for
1
you
1
tomorrow
3
morning
2
She
0
left
1
Dorothy
3
alone
2
and
1
went
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
others
2
These
1
she
0
also
2
led
0
to
1
rooms
1
and
1
each
2
one
1
of
1
them
1
found
1
himself
2
lodged
1
in
1
a
1
very
2
pleasant
3
part
1
of
1
the
1
Palace
2
Of
1
course
1
this
1
politeness
4
was
1
wasted
1
on
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
for
1
when
1
he
1
found
1
himself
2
alone
2
in
1
his
1
room
1
he
1
stood
1
stupidly
3
in
1
one
1
spot
1
just
1
within
2
the
1
doorway
2
to
1
wait
1
till
1
morning
2
It
1
would
1
not
1
rest
1
him
1
to
1
lie
1
down
1
and
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
close
1
his
1
eyes
0
so
1
he
1
remained
2
all
1
night
1
staring
2
at
1
a
1
little
1
spider
2
which
1
was
1
weaving
3
its
1
web
1
in
1
a
1
corner
2
of
1
the
1
room
1
just
1
as
1
if
1
it
1
were
1
not
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
most
1
wonderful
3
rooms
1
in
1
the

The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
lay
1
down
1
on
1
his
1
bed
0
from
1
force
1
of
1
habit
2
for
1
he
1
remembered
3
when
1
he
1
was
1
made
1
of
1
flesh
1
but
1
not
1
being
1
able
1
to
1
sleep
1
he
1
passed
1
the
1
night
1
moving
2
his
1
joints
1
up
1
and
1
down
1
to
1
make
1
sure
1
they
1
kept
1
in
1
good
1
working
2
order

The
1
Lion
1
would
1
have
1
preferred
2
a
1
bed
0
of
1
dried
1
leaves
2
in
1
the
1
forest
2
and
1
did
1
not
1
like
1
being
1
shut
1
up
1
in
1
a
1
room
1
but
1
he
1
had
1
too
1
much
1
sense
1
to
1
let
1
this
1
worry
2
him
1
so
1
he
1
sprang
1
upon
2
the
1
bed
0
and
1
rolled
1
himself
2
up
1
like
1
a
1
cat
1
and
1
purred
1
himself
2
asleep
2
in
1
a
1
minute
2
The
1
next
1
morning
2
after
2
breakfast
3
the
1
green
1
maiden
2
came
1
to
1
fetch
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
she
0
dressed
1
her
1
in
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
prettiest
3
gowns
1
made
1
of
1
green
1
brocaded
2
satin
2
Dorothy
3
put
1
on
1
a
1
green
1
silk
1
apron
2
and
1
tied
1
a
1
green
1
ribbon
2
around
2
Toto
2
's
0
neck
1
and
1
they
1
started
1
for
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
of
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
First
1
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
great
2
hall
1
in
1
which
1
were
1
many
2
ladies
2
and
1
gentlemen
3
of
1
the
1
court
1
all
1
dressed
1
in
1
rich
1
costumes
2
These
1
people
1
had
1
nothing
2
to
1
do
1
but
1
talk
1
to
1
each
2
other
2
but
1
they
1
always
2
came
1
to
1
wait
1
outside
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
every
3
morning
2
although
2
they
1
were
1
never
2
permitted
2
to
1
see
1
Oz
1
As
1
Dorothy
3
entered
2
they
1
looked
1
at
1
her
1
curiously
3
and
1
one
1
of
1
them
1
whispered
2
Are
1
you
1
really
3
going
1
to
1
look
1
upon
2
the
1
face
1
of
1
Oz
1
the
1
Terrible
2
Of
1
course
1
answered
2
the
1
girl
1
if
1
he
1
will
1
see
1
me
1
Oh
1
he
1
will
1
see
1
you
1
said
1
the
1
soldier
3
who
1
had
1
taken
2
her
1
message
2
to
1
the
1
Wizard
2
although
2
he
1
does
0
not
1
like
1
to
1
have
1
people
1
ask
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
Indeed
1
at
1
first
1
he
1
was
1
angry
2
and
1
said
1
I
1
should
1
send
1
you
1
back
1
where
1
you
1
came
1
from
1
Then
1
he
1
asked
1
me
1
what
1
you
1
looked
1
like
1
and
1
when
1
I
1
mentioned
2
your
1
silver
2
shoes
0
he
1
was
1
very
2
much
1
interested
3
At
1
last
1
I
1
told
1
him
1
about
2
the
1
mark
1
upon
2
your
1
forehead
4
and
1
he
1
decided
2
he
1
would
1
admit
2
you
1
to
1
his
1
presence
2
Just
1
then
1
a
1
bell
1
rang
1
and
1
the
1
green
1
girl
1
said
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
That
1
is
1
the
1
signal
2
You
1
must
1
go
1
into
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
alone
2
She
0
opened
2
a
1
little
1
door
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
walked
1
boldly
2
through
1
and
1
found
1
herself
2
in
1
a
1
wonderful
3
place
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
big
1
round
1
room
1
with
1
a
1
high
1
arched
1
roof
1
and
1
the
1
walls
1
and
1
ceiling
2
and
1
floor
1
were
1
covered
2
with
1
large
1
emeralds
3
set
1
closely
3
together
3
In
1
the
1
center
2
of
1
the
1
roof
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
light
1
as
1
bright
1
as
1
the
1
sun
1
which
1
made
1
the
1
emeralds
3
sparkle
1
in
1
a
1
wonderful
3
manner
2
But
1
what
1
interested
3
Dorothy
3
most
1
was
1
the
1
big
1
throne
1
of
1
green
1
marble
1
that
1
stood
1
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
room
1
It
1
was
1
shaped
1
like
1
a
1
chair
1
and
1
sparkled
1
with
1
gems
1
as
1
did
1
everything
4
else
1
In
1
the
1
center
2
of
1
the
1
chair
1
was
1
an
1
enormous
3
Head
2
without
2
a
1
body
2
to
1
support
2
it
1
or
1
any
2
arms
1
or
1
legs
1
whatever
3
There
1
was
1
no
1
hair
1
upon
2
this
1
head
2
but
1
it
1
had
1
eyes
0
and
1
a
1
nose
1
and
1
mouth
1
and
1
was
1
much
1
bigger
2
than
1
the
1
head
2
of
1
the
1
biggest
2
giant
2
As
1
Dorothy
3
gazed
1
upon
2
this
1
in
1
wonder
2
and
1
fear
2
the
1
eyes
0
turned
1
slowly
2
and
1
looked
1
at
1
her
1
sharply
2
and
1
steadily
4
Then
1
the
1
mouth
1
moved
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
heard
2
a
1
voice
1
say
1
I
1
am
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
Who
1
are
1
you
1
and
1
why
1
do
1
you
1
seek
1
me
1
It
1
was
1
not
1
such
1
an
1
awful
2
voice
1
as
1
she
0
had
1
expected
2
to
1
come
1
from
1
the
1
big
1
Head
2
so
1
she
0
took
1
courage
2
and
1
answered
2
I
1
am
1
Dorothy
3
the
1
Small
1
and
1
Meek
1
I
1
have
1
come
1
to
1
you
1
for
1
help
1
The
1
eyes
0
looked
1
at
1
her
1
thoughtfully
3
for
1
a
1
full
1
minute
2
Then
1
said
1
the
1
voice
1
Where
1
did
1
you
1
get
1
the
1
silver
2
shoes
0
I
1
got
1
them
1
from
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
when
1
my
1
house
1
fell
1
on
1
her
1
and
1
killed
1
her
1
she
0
replied
2
Where
1
did
1
you
1
get
1
the
1
mark
1
upon
2
your
1
forehead
4
continued
2
the
1
voice
1
That
1
is
1
where
1
the
1
Good
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
kissed
1
me
1
when
1
she
0
bade
1
me
1
good-bye
1
and
1
sent
1
me
1
to
1
you
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
Again
2
the
1
eyes
0
looked
1
at
1
her
1
sharply
2
and
1
they
1
saw
1
she
0
was
1
telling
2
the
1
truth
1
Then
1
Oz
1
asked
1
What
1
do
1
you
1
wish
1
me
1
to
1
do
1
Send
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
where
1
my
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
and
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
are
1
she
0
answered
2
earnestly
4
I
1
do
1
n't
0
like
1
your
1
country
2
although
2
it
1
is
1
so
1
beautiful
4
And
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
will
1
be
1
dreadfully
4
worried
2
over
2
my
1
being
1
away
2
so
1
long
1
The
1
eyes
0
winked
1
three
1
times
1
and
1
then
1
they
1
turned
1
up
1
to
1
the
1
ceiling
2
and
1
down
1
to
1
the
1
floor
1
and
1
rolled
1
around
2
so
1
queerly
2
that
1
they
1
seemed
1
to
1
see
1
every
3
part
1
of
1
the
1
room
1
And
1
at
1
last
1
they
1
looked
1
at
1
Dorothy
3
again
2
Why
1
should
1
I
1
do
1
this
1
for
1
you
1
asked
1
Oz
1
Because
2
you
1
are
1
strong
1
and
1
I
1
am
1
weak
2
because
2
you
1
are
1
a
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
and
1
I
1
am
1
only
2
a
1
little
1
girl
1
But
1
you
1
were
1
strong
1
enough
2
to
1
kill
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
said
1
Oz
1
That
1
just
1
happened
2
returned
2
Dorothy
3
simply
2
I
1
could
1
not
1
help
1
it
1
Well
1
said
1
the
1
Head
2
I
1
will
1
give
1
you
1
my
1
answer
2
You
1
have
1
no
1
right
1
to
1
expect
2
me
1
to
1
send
1
you
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
unless
2
you
1
do
1
something
3
for
1
me
1
in
1
return
2
In
1
this
1
country
2
everyone
3
must
1
pay
1
for
1
everything
4
he
1
gets
1
If
1
you
1
wish
1
me
1
to
1
use
1
my
1
magic
2
power
2
to
1
send
1
you
1
home
1
again
2
you
1
must
1
do
1
something
3
for
1
me
1
first
1
Help
1
me
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
help
1
you
1
What
1
must
1
I
1
do
1
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
Kill
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
answered
2
Oz
1
But
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
exclaimed
2
Dorothy
3
greatly
3
surprised
2
You
1
killed
1
the
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
and
1
you
1
wear
2
the
1
silver
2
shoes
0
which
1
bear
2
a
1
powerful
3
charm
1
There
1
is
1
now
1
but
1
one
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
left
1
in
1
all
1
this
1
land
1
and
1
when
1
you
1
can
1
tell
1
me
1
she
0
is
1
dead
2
I
1
will
1
send
1
you
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
but
1
not
1
before
2
The
1
little
1
girl
1
began
2
to
1
weep
1
she
0
was
1
so
1
much
1
disappointed
3
and
1
the
1
eyes
0
winked
1
again
2
and
1
looked
1
upon
2
her
1
anxiously
3
as
1
if
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
felt
1
that
1
she
0
could
1
help
1
him
1
if
1
she
0
would
1
I
1
never
2
killed
1
anything
3
willingly
3
she
0
sobbed
1
Even
2
if
1
I
1
wanted
1
to
1
how
1
could
1
I
1
kill
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
If
1
you
1
who
1
are
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
can
1
not
1
kill
1
her
1
yourself
2
how
1
do
1
you
1
expect
2
me
1
to
1
do
1
it
1
I
1
do
1
not
1
know
1
said
1
the
1
Head
2
but
1
that
1
is
1
my
1
answer
2
and
1
until
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
dies
1
you
1
will
1
not
1
see
1
your
1
uncle
1
and
1
aunt
1
again
2
Remember
3
that
1
the
1
Witch
1
is
1
Wicked
1
tremendously
4
Wicked
1
and
1
ought
1
to
1
be
1
killed
1
Now
1
go
1
and
1
do
1
not
1
ask
1
to
1
see
1
me
1
again
2
until
2
you
1
have
1
done
1
your
1
task
1
Sorrowfully
4
Dorothy
3
left
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
went
1
back
1
where
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
were
1
waiting
2
to
1
hear
2
what
1
Oz
1
had
1
said
1
to
1
her
1
There
1
is
1
no
1
hope
1
for
1
me
1
she
0
said
1
sadly
2
for
1
Oz
1
will
1
not
1
send
1
me
1
home
1
until
2
I
1
have
1
killed
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
and
1
that
1
I
1
can
1
never
2
do
1
Her
1
friends
2
were
1
sorry
2
but
1
could
1
do
1
nothing
2
to
1
help
1
her
1
so
1
Dorothy
3
went
1
to
1
her
1
own
1
room
1
and
1
lay
1
down
1
on
1
the
1
bed
0
and
1
cried
1
herself
2
to
1
sleep
1
The
1
next
1
morning
2
the
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
came
1
to
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
said
1
Come
1
with
1
me
1
for
1
Oz
1
has
1
sent
1
for
1
you
1
So
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
followed
2
him
1
and
1
was
1
admitted
2
into
2
the
1
great
2
Throne
1
Room
1
where
1
he
1
saw
1
sitting
2
in
1
the
1
emerald
3
throne
1
a
1
most
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
She
0
was
1
dressed
1
in
1
green
1
silk
1
gauze
1
and
1
wore
1
upon
2
her
1
flowing
2
green
1
locks
1
a
1
crown
1
of
1
jewels
2
Growing
2
from
1
her
1
shoulders
2
were
1
wings
1
gorgeous
2
in
1
color
2
and
1
so
1
light
1
that
1
they
1
fluttered
2
if
1
the
1
slightest
2
breath
2
of
1
air
1
reached
2
them
1
When
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
had
1
bowed
1
as
1
prettily
3
as
1
his
1
straw
1
stuffing
2
would
1
let
1
him
1
before
2
this
1
beautiful
4
creature
3
she
0
looked
1
upon
2
him
1
sweetly
2
and
1
said
1
I
1
am
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
Who
1
are
1
you
1
and
1
why
1
do
1
you
1
seek
1
me
1
Now
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
who
1
had
1
expected
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
great
2
Head
2
Dorothy
3
had
1
told
1
him
1
of
1
was
1
much
1
astonished
3
but
1
he
1
answered
2
her
1
bravely
3
I
1
am
1
only
2
a
1
Scarecrow
3
stuffed
1
with
1
straw
1
Therefore
3
I
1
have
1
no
1
brains
1
and
1
I
1
come
1
to
1
you
1
praying
1
that
1
you
1
will
1
put
1
brains
1
in
1
my
1
head
2
instead
3
of
1
straw
1
so
1
that
1
I
1
may
1
become
2
as
1
much
1
a
1
man
1
as
1
any
2
other
2
in
1
your
1
dominions
3
Why
1
should
1
I
1
do
1
this
1
for
1
you
1
asked
1
the
1
Lady
2
Because
2
you
1
are
1
wise
1
and
1
powerful
3
and
1
no
1
one
1
else
1
can
1
help
1
me
1
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
never
2
grant
1
favors
2
without
2
some
1
return
2
said
1
Oz
1
but
1
this
1
much
1
I
1
will
1
promise
2
If
1
you
1
will
1
kill
1
for
1
me
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
I
1
will
1
bestow
2
upon
2
you
1
a
1
great
2
many
2
brains
1
and
1
such
1
good
1
brains
1
that
1
you
1
will
1
be
1
the
1
wisest
2
man
1
in
1
all
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
I
1
thought
1
you
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
kill
1
the
1
Witch
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
in
1
surprise
2
So
1
I
1
did
1
I
1
do
1
n't
0
care
1
who
1
kills
1
her
1
But
1
until
2
she
0
is
1
dead
2
I
1
will
1
not
1
grant
1
your
1
wish
1
Now
1
go
1
and
1
do
1
not
1
seek
1
me
1
again
2
until
2
you
1
have
1
earned
2
the
1
brains
1
you
1
so
1
greatly
3
desire
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
went
1
sorrowfully
4
back
1
to
1
his
1
friends
2
and
1
told
1
them
1
what
1
Oz
1
had
1
said
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
surprised
2
to
1
find
1
that
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
was
1
not
1
a
1
Head
2
as
1
she
0
had
1
seen
1
him
1
but
1
a
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
All
1
the
1
same
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
she
0
needs
1
a
1
heart
2
as
1
much
1
as
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
On
1
the
1
next
1
morning
2
the
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
came
1
to
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
said
1
Oz
1
has
1
sent
1
for
1
you
1
Follow
2
me
1
So
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
followed
2
him
1
and
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
great
2
Throne
1
Room
1
He
1
did
1
not
1
know
1
whether
2
he
1
would
1
find
1
Oz
1
a
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
or
1
a
1
Head
2
but
1
he
1
hoped
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
the
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
For
1
he
1
said
1
to
1
himself
2
if
1
it
1
is
1
the
1
head
2
I
1
am
1
sure
1
I
1
shall
1
not
1
be
1
given
2
a
1
heart
2
since
1
a
1
head
2
has
1
no
1
heart
2
of
1
its
1
own
1
and
1
therefore
3
can
1
not
1
feel
1
for
1
me
1
But
1
if
1
it
1
is
1
the
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
I
1
shall
1
beg
1
hard
1
for
1
a
1
heart
2
for
1
all
1
ladies
2
are
1
themselves
2
said
1
to
1
be
1
kindly
2
hearted
2
But
1
when
1
the
1
Woodman
2
entered
2
the
1
great
2
Throne
1
Room
1
he
1
saw
1
neither
2
the
1
Head
2
nor
1
the
1
Lady
2
for
1
Oz
1
had
1
taken
2
the
1
shape
1
of
1
a
1
most
1
terrible
2
Beast
2
It
1
was
1
nearly
3
as
1
big
1
as
1
an
1
elephant
3
and
1
the
1
green
1
throne
1
seemed
1
hardly
2
strong
1
enough
2
to
1
hold
1
its
1
weight
1
The
1
Beast
2
had
1
a
1
head
2
like
1
that
1
of
1
a
1
rhinoceros
4
only
2
there
1
were
1
five
1
eyes
0
in
1
its
1
face
1
There
1
were
1
five
1
long
1
arms
1
growing
2
out
1
of
1
its
1
body
2
and
1
it
1
also
2
had
1
five
1
long
1
slim
1
legs
1
Thick
1
woolly
2
hair
1
covered
2
every
3
part
1
of
1
it
1
and
1
a
1
more
1
dreadful-looking
5
monster
2
could
1
not
1
be
1
imagined
3
It
1
was
1
fortunate
3
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
had
1
no
1
heart
2
at
1
that
1
moment
2
for
1
it
1
would
1
have
1
beat
2
loud
1
and
1
fast
1
from
1
terror
2
But
1
being
1
only
2
tin
1
the
1
Woodman
2
was
1
not
1
at
1
all
1
afraid
2
although
2
he
1
was
1
much
1
disappointed
3
I
1
am
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
spoke
1
the
1
Beast
2
in
1
a
1
voice
1
that
1
was
1
one
1
great
2
roar
1
Who
1
are
1
you
1
and
1
why
1
do
1
you
1
seek
1
me
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
Woodman
2
and
1
made
1
of
1
tin
1
Therefore
3
I
1
have
1
no
1
heart
2
and
1
can
1
not
1
love
1
I
1
pray
1
you
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
that
1
I
1
may
1
be
1
as
1
other
2
men
1
are
1
Why
1
should
1
I
1
do
1
this
1
demanded
2
the
1
Beast
2
Because
2
I
1
ask
1
it
1
and
1
you
1
alone
2
can
1
grant
1
my
1
request
2
answered
2
the
1
Woodman
2
Oz
1
gave
1
a
1
low
1
growl
1
at
1
this
1
but
1
said
1
gruffly
2
If
1
you
1
indeed
1
desire
2
a
1
heart
2
you
1
must
1
earn
2
it
1
How
1
asked
1
the
1
Woodman
2
Help
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
kill
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
replied
2
the
1
Beast
2
When
1
the
1
Witch
1
is
1
dead
2
come
1
to
1
me
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
then
1
give
1
you
1
the
1
biggest
2
and
1
kindest
2
and
1
most
1
loving
2
heart
2
in
1
all
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
So
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
was
1
forced
1
to
1
return
2
sorrowfully
4
to
1
his
1
friends
2
and
1
tell
1
them
1
of
1
the
1
terrible
2
Beast
2
he
1
had
1
seen
1
They
1
all
1
wondered
2
greatly
3
at
1
the
1
many
2
forms
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
could
1
take
1
upon
2
himself
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
said
1
If
1
he
1
is
1
a
1
Beast
2
when
1
I
1
go
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
I
1
shall
1
roar
1
my
1
loudest
2
and
1
so
1
frighten
2
him
1
that
1
he
1
will
1
grant
1
all
1
I
1
ask
1
And
1
if
1
he
1
is
1
the
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
I
1
shall
1
pretend
2
to
1
spring
1
upon
2
her
1
and
1
so
1
compel
2
her
1
to
1
do
1
my
1
bidding
2
And
1
if
1
he
1
is
1
the
1
great
2
Head
2
he
1
will
1
be
1
at
1
my
1
mercy
2
for
1
I
1
will
1
roll
1
this
1
head
2
all
1
about
2
the
1
room
1
until
2
he
1
promises
2
to
1
give
1
us
1
what
1
we
1
desire
2
So
1
be
1
of
1
good
1
cheer
1
my
1
friends
2
for
1
all
1
will
1
yet
1
be
1
well
1
The
1
next
1
morning
2
the
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
led
0
the
1
Lion
1
to
1
the
1
great
2
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
bade
1
him
1
enter
2
the
1
presence
2
of
1
Oz
1
The
1
Lion
1
at
1
once
1
passed
1
through
1
the
1
door
1
and
1
glancing
2
around
2
saw
1
to
1
his
1
surprise
2
that
1
before
2
the
1
throne
1
was
1
a
1
Ball
1
of
1
Fire
1
so
1
fierce
2
and
1
glowing
2
he
1
could
1
scarcely
3
bear
2
to
1
gaze
1
upon
2
it
1
His
1
first
1
thought
1
was
1
that
1
Oz
1
had
1
by
1
accident
3
caught
1
on
1
fire
1
and
1
was
1
burning
2
up
1
but
1
when
1
he
1
tried
1
to
1
go
1
nearer
3
the
1
heat
2
was
1
so
1
intense
2
that
1
it
1
singed
1
his
1
whiskers
2
and
1
he
1
crept
1
back
1
tremblingly
3
to
1
a
1
spot
1
nearer
3
the
1
door
1
Then
1
a
1
low
1
quiet
2
voice
1
came
1
from
1
the
1
Ball
1
of
1
Fire
1
and
1
these
1
were
1
the
1
words
1
it
1
spoke
1
I
1
am
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
Who
1
are
1
you
1
and
1
why
1
do
1
you
1
seek
1
me
1
And
1
the
1
Lion
1
answered
2
I
1
am
1
a
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
afraid
2
of
1
everything
4
I
1
came
1
to
1
you
1
to
1
beg
1
that
1
you
1
give
1
me
1
courage
2
so
1
that
1
in
1
reality
4
I
1
may
1
become
2
the
1
King
1
of
1
Beasts
2
as
1
men
1
call
1
me
1
Why
1
should
1
I
1
give
1
you
1
courage
2
demanded
2
Oz
1
Because
2
of
1
all
1
Wizards
2
you
1
are
1
the
1
greatest
3
and
1
alone
2
have
1
power
2
to
1
grant
1
my
1
request
2
answered
2
the
1
Lion
1
The
1
Ball
1
of
1
Fire
1
burned
1
fiercely
4
for
1
a
1
time
1
and
1
the
1
voice
1
said
1
Bring
1
me
1
proof
1
that
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
is
1
dead
2
and
1
that
1
moment
2
I
1
will
1
give
1
you
1
courage
2
But
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
the
1
Witch
1
lives
1
you
1
must
1
remain
2
a
1
coward
2
The
1
Lion
1
was
1
angry
2
at
1
this
1
speech
1
but
1
could
1
say
1
nothing
2
in
1
reply
2
and
1
while
1
he
1
stood
1
silently
3
gazing
2
at
1
the
1
Ball
1
of
1
Fire
1
it
1
became
2
so
1
furiously
3
hot
1
that
1
he
1
turned
1
tail
1
and
1
rushed
1
from
1
the
1
room
1
He
1
was
1
glad
1
to
1
find
1
his
1
friends
2
waiting
2
for
1
him
1
and
1
told
1
them
1
of
1
his
1
terrible
2
interview
4
with
1
the
1
Wizard
2
What
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
now
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
sadly
2
There
1
is
1
only
2
one
1
thing
1
we
1
can
1
do
1
returned
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
that
1
is
1
to
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
land
1
of
1
the
1
Winkies
2
seek
1
out
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
and
1
destroy
2
her
1
But
1
suppose
2
we
1
can
1
not
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
Then
1
I
1
shall
1
never
2
have
1
courage
2
declared
2
the
1
Lion
1
And
1
I
1
shall
1
never
2
have
1
brains
1
added
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
And
1
I
1
shall
1
never
2
have
1
a
1
heart
2
spoke
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
And
1
I
1
shall
1
never
2
see
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
and
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
beginning
3
to
1
cry
1
Be
1
careful
3
cried
1
the
1
green
1
girl
1
The
1
tears
2
will
1
fall
1
on
1
your
1
green
1
silk
1
gown
1
and
1
spot
1
it
1
So
1
Dorothy
3
dried
1
her
1
eyes
0
and
1
said
1
I
1
suppose
2
we
1
must
1
try
1
it
1
but
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
I
1
do
1
not
1
want
1
to
1
kill
1
anybody
4
even
2
to
1
see
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
again
2
I
1
will
1
go
1
with
1
you
1
but
1
I
1
'm
0
too
1
much
1
of
1
a
1
coward
2
to
1
kill
1
the
1
Witch
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
will
1
go
1
too
1
declared
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
I
1
shall
1
not
1
be
1
of
1
much
1
help
1
to
1
you
1
I
1
am
1
such
1
a
1
fool
1
I
1
have
1
n't
0
the
1
heart
2
to
1
harm
1
even
2
a
1
Witch
1
remarked
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
but
1
if
1
you
1
go
1
I
1
certainly
3
shall
1
go
1
with
1
you
1
Therefore
3
it
1
was
1
decided
2
to
1
start
1
upon
2
their
1
journey
2
the
1
next
1
morning
2
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
sharpened
2
his
1
axe
1
on
1
a
1
green
1
grindstone
2
and
1
had
1
all
1
his
1
joints
1
properly
3
oiled
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
stuffed
1
himself
2
with
1
fresh
1
straw
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
put
1
new
1
paint
1
on
1
his
1
eyes
0
that
1
he
1
might
1
see
1
better
2
The
1
green
1
girl
1
who
1
was
1
very
2
kind
1
to
1
them
1
filled
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
basket
2
with
1
good
1
things
1
to
1
eat
2
and
1
fastened
2
a
1
little
1
bell
1
around
2
Toto
2
's
0
neck
1
with
1
a
1
green
1
ribbon
2
They
1
went
1
to
1
bed
0
quite
1
early
3
and
1
slept
1
soundly
2
until
2
daylight
2
when
1
they
1
were
1
awakened
3
by
1
the
1
crowing
2
of
1
a
1
green
1
cock
1
that
1
lived
1
in
1
the
1
back
1
yard
2
of
1
the
1
Palace
2
and
1
the
1
cackling
2
of
1
a
1
hen
1
that
1
had
1
laid
1
a
1
green
1
egg
1
The
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
led
0
them
1
through
1
the
1
streets
1
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
until
2
they
1
reached
2
the
1
room
1
where
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
lived
1
This
1
officer
3
unlocked
2
their
1
spectacles
2
to
1
put
1
them
1
back
1
in
1
his
1
great
2
box
1
and
1
then
1
he
1
politely
4
opened
2
the
1
gate
1
for
1
our
1
friends
2
Which
1
road
1
leads
2
to
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
There
1
is
1
no
1
road
1
answered
2
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
No
1
one
1
ever
2
wishes
1
to
1
go
1
that
1
way
1
How
1
then
1
are
1
we
1
to
1
find
1
her
1
inquired
2
the
1
girl
1
That
1
will
1
be
1
easy
3
replied
2
the
1
man
1
for
1
when
1
she
0
knows
1
you
1
are
1
in
1
the
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
Winkies
2
she
0
will
1
find
1
you
1
and
1
make
1
you
1
all
1
her
1
slaves
1
Perhaps
2
not
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
for
1
we
1
mean
2
to
1
destroy
2
her
1
Oh
1
that
1
is
1
different
3
said
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
No
1
one
1
has
1
ever
2
destroyed
1
her
1
before
2
so
1
I
1
naturally
4
thought
1
she
0
would
1
make
1
slaves
1
of
1
you
1
as
1
she
0
has
1
of
1
the
1
rest
1
But
1
take
1
care
1
for
1
she
0
is
1
wicked
1
and
1
fierce
2
and
1
may
1
not
1
allow
2
you
1
to
1
destroy
2
her
1
Keep
1
to
1
the
1
West
1
where
1
the
1
sun
1
sets
1
and
1
you
1
can
1
not
1
fail
1
to
1
find
1
her
1
They
1
thanked
1
him
1
and
1
bade
1
him
1
good-bye
1
and
1
turned
1
toward
2
the
1
West
1
walking
2
over
2
fields
2
of
1
soft
1
grass
1
dotted
1
here
1
and
1
there
1
with
1
daisies
2
and
1
buttercups
3
Dorothy
3
still
1
wore
1
the
1
pretty
2
silk
1
dress
1
she
0
had
1
put
1
on
1
in
1
the
1
palace
2
but
1
now
1
to
1
her
1
surprise
2
she
0
found
1
it
1
was
1
no
1
longer
2
green
1
but
1
pure
1
white
1
The
1
ribbon
2
around
2
Toto
2
's
0
neck
1
had
1
also
2
lost
1
its
1
green
1
color
2
and
1
was
1
as
1
white
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
dress
1
The
1
Emerald
3
City
2
was
1
soon
1
left
1
far
1
behind
2
As
1
they
1
advanced
2
the
1
ground
1
became
2
rougher
2
and
1
hillier
3
for
1
there
1
were
1
no
1
farms
1
nor
1
houses
1
in
1
this
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
West
1
and
1
the
1
ground
1
was
1
untilled
2
In
1
the
1
afternoon
3
the
1
sun
1
shone
1
hot
1
in
1
their
1
faces
1
for
1
there
1
were
1
no
1
trees
0
to
1
offer
2
them
1
shade
1
so
1
that
1
before
2
night
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
Toto
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
were
1
tired
1
and
1
lay
1
down
1
upon
2
the
1
grass
1
and
1
fell
1
asleep
2
with
1
the
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
keeping
2
watch
1
Now
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
had
1
but
1
one
1
eye
0
yet
1
that
1
was
1
as
1
powerful
3
as
1
a
1
telescope
3
and
1
could
1
see
1
everywhere
4
So
1
as
1
she
0
sat
1
in
1
the
1
door
1
of
1
her
1
castle
1
she
0
happened
2
to
1
look
1
around
2
and
1
saw
1
Dorothy
3
lying
1
asleep
2
with
1
her
1
friends
2
all
1
about
2
her
1
They
1
were
1
a
1
long
1
distance
2
off
1
but
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
was
1
angry
2
to
1
find
1
them
1
in
1
her
1
country
2
so
1
she
0
blew
1
upon
2
a
1
silver
2
whistle
1
that
1
hung
1
around
2
her
1
neck
1
At
1
once
1
there
1
came
1
running
2
to
1
her
1
from
1
all
1
directions
3
a
1
pack
1
of
1
great
2
wolves
1
They
1
had
1
long
1
legs
1
and
1
fierce
2
eyes
0
and
1
sharp
1
teeth
1
Go
1
to
1
those
1
people
1
said
1
the
1
Witch
1
and
1
tear
2
them
1
to
1
pieces
2
Are
1
you
1
not
1
going
1
to
1
make
1
them
1
your
1
slaves
1
asked
1
the
1
leader
3
of
1
the
1
wolves
1
No
1
she
0
answered
2
one
1
is
1
of
1
tin
1
and
1
one
1
of
1
straw
1
one
1
is
1
a
1
girl
1
and
1
another
3
a
1
Lion
1
None
1
of
1
them
1
is
1
fit
1
to
1
work
1
so
1
you
1
may
1
tear
2
them
1
into
2
small
1
pieces
2
Very
2
well
1
said
1
the
1
wolf
1
and
1
he
1
dashed
1
away
2
at
1
full
1
speed
0
followed
2
by
1
the
1
others
2
It
1
was
1
lucky
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
were
1
wide
1
awake
2
and
1
heard
2
the
1
wolves
1
coming
2
This
1
is
1
my
1
fight
1
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
so
1
get
1
behind
2
me
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
meet
1
them
1
as
1
they
1
come
1
He
1
seized
1
his
1
axe
1
which
1
he
1
had
1
made
1
very
2
sharp
1
and
1
as
1
the
1
leader
3
of
1
the
1
wolves
1
came
1
on
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
swung
1
his
1
arm
1
and
1
chopped
1
the
1
wolf's
1
head
2
from
1
its
1
body
2
so
1
that
1
it
1
immediately
6
died
1
As
1
soon
1
as
1
he
1
could
1
raise
1
his
1
axe
1
another
3
wolf
1
came
1
up
1
and
1
he
1
also
2
fell
1
under
2
the
1
sharp
1
edge
1
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
's
0
weapon
3
There
1
were
1
forty
2
wolves
1
and
1
forty
2
times
1
a
1
wolf
1
was
1
killed
1
so
1
that
1
at
1
last
1
they
1
all
1
lay
1
dead
2
in
1
a
1
heap
2
before
2
the
1
Woodman
2
Then
1
he
1
put
1
down
1
his
1
axe
1
and
1
sat
1
beside
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
who
1
said
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
good
1
fight
1
friend
2
They
1
waited
1
until
2
Dorothy
3
awoke
2
the
1
next
1
morning
2
The
1
little
1
girl
1
was
1
quite
1
frightened
2
when
1
she
0
saw
1
the
1
great
2
pile
1
of
1
shaggy
2
wolves
1
but
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
told
1
her
1
all
1
She
0
thanked
1
him
1
for
1
saving
2
them
1
and
1
sat
1
down
1
to
1
breakfast
3
after
2
which
1
they
1
started
1
again
2
upon
2
their
1
journey
2
Now
1
this
1
same
1
morning
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
door
1
of
1
her
1
castle
1
and
1
looked
1
out
1
with
1
her
1
one
1
eye
0
that
1
could
1
see
1
far
1
off
1
She
0
saw
1
all
1
her
1
wolves
1
lying
1
dead
2
and
1
the
1
strangers
2
still
1
traveling
3
through
1
her
1
country
2
This
1
made
1
her
1
angrier
3
than
1
before
2
and
1
she
0
blew
1
her
1
silver
2
whistle
1
twice
1
Straightway
2
a
1
great
2
flock
1
of
1
wild
1
crows
1
came
1
flying
1
toward
2
her
1
enough
2
to
1
darken
2
the
1
sky
1
And
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
said
1
to
1
the
1
King
1
Crow
1
Fly
1
at
1
once
1
to
1
the
1
strangers
2
peck
1
out
1
their
1
eyes
0
and
1
tear
2
them
1
to
1
pieces
2
The
1
wild
1
crows
1
flew
1
in
1
one
1
great
2
flock
1
toward
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
companions
3
When
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
saw
1
them
1
coming
2
she
0
was
1
afraid
2
But
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
said
1
This
1
is
1
my
1
battle
1
so
1
lie
1
down
1
beside
2
me
1
and
1
you
1
will
1
not
1
be
1
harmed
1
So
1
they
1
all
1
lay
1
upon
2
the
1
ground
1
except
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
he
1
stood
1
up
1
and
1
stretched
1
out
1
his
1
arms
1
And
1
when
1
the
1
crows
1
saw
1
him
1
they
1
were
1
frightened
2
as
1
these
1
birds
1
always
2
are
1
by
1
scarecrows
3
and
1
did
1
not
1
dare
1
to
1
come
1
any
2
nearer
3
But
1
the
1
King
1
Crow
1
said
1
It
1
is
1
only
2
a
1
stuffed
1
man
1
I
1
will
1
peck
1
his
1
eyes
0
out
1
The
1
King
1
Crow
1
flew
1
at
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
who
1
caught
1
it
1
by
1
the
1
head
2
and
1
twisted
1
its
1
neck
1
until
2
it
1
died
1
And
1
then
1
another
3
crow
1
flew
1
at
1
him
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
twisted
1
its
1
neck
1
also
2
There
1
were
1
forty
2
crows
1
and
1
forty
2
times
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
twisted
1
a
1
neck
1
until
2
at
1
last
1
all
1
were
1
lying
1
dead
2
beside
2
him
1
Then
1
he
1
called
1
to
1
his
1
companions
3
to
1
rise
1
and
1
again
2
they
1
went
1
upon
2
their
1
journey
2
When
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
looked
1
out
1
again
2
and
1
saw
1
all
1
her
1
crows
1
lying
1
in
1
a
1
heap
2
she
0
got
1
into
2
a
1
terrible
2
rage
1
and
1
blew
1
three
1
times
1
upon
2
her
1
silver
2
whistle
1
Forthwith
2
there
1
was
1
heard
2
a
1
great
2
buzzing
2
in
1
the
1
air
1
and
1
a
1
swarm
1
of
1
black
1
bees
0
came
1
flying
1
toward
2
her
1
Go
1
to
1
the
1
strangers
2
and
1
sting
1
them
1
to
1
death
2
commanded
2
the
1
Witch
1
and
1
the
1
bees
0
turned
1
and
1
flew
1
rapidly
3
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
where
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
friends
2
were
1
walking
2
But
1
the
1
Woodman
2
had
1
seen
1
them
1
coming
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
had
1
decided
2
what
1
to
1
do
1
Take
1
out
1
my
1
straw
1
and
1
scatter
2
it
1
over
2
the
1
little
1
girl
1
and
1
the
1
dog
1
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
he
1
said
1
to
1
the
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
bees
0
can
1
not
1
sting
1
them
1
This
1
the
1
Woodman
2
did
1
and
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
lay
1
close
1
beside
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
held
1
Toto
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
the
1
straw
1
covered
2
them
1
entirely
4
The
1
bees
0
came
1
and
1
found
1
no
1
one
1
but
1
the
1
Woodman
2
to
1
sting
1
so
1
they
1
flew
1
at
1
him
1
and
1
broke
1
off
1
all
1
their
1
stings
1
against
2
the
1
tin
1
without
2
hurting
2
the
1
Woodman
2
at
1
all
1
And
1
as
1
bees
0
can
1
not
1
live
1
when
1
their
1
stings
1
are
1
broken
2
that
1
was
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
the
1
black
1
bees
0
and
1
they
1
lay
1
scattered
2
thick
1
about
2
the
1
Woodman
2
like
1
little
1
heaps
2
of
1
fine
1
coal
1
Then
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
got
1
up
1
and
1
the
1
girl
1
helped
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
put
1
the
1
straw
1
back
1
into
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
again
2
until
2
he
1
was
1
as
1
good
1
as
1
ever
2
So
1
they
1
started
1
upon
2
their
1
journey
2
once
1
more
1
The
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
was
1
so
1
angry
2
when
1
she
0
saw
1
her
1
black
1
bees
0
in
1
little
1
heaps
2
like
1
fine
1
coal
1
that
1
she
0
stamped
1
her
1
foot
1
and
1
tore
1
her
1
hair
1
and
1
gnashed
1
her
1
teeth
1
And
1
then
1
she
0
called
1
a
1
dozen
2
of
1
her
1
slaves
1
who
1
were
1
the
1
Winkies
2
and
1
gave
1
them
1
sharp
1
spears
2
telling
2
them
1
to
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
strangers
2
and
1
destroy
2
them
1
The
1
Winkies
2
were
1
not
1
a
1
brave
1
people
1
but
1
they
1
had
1
to
1
do
1
as
1
they
1
were
1
told
1
So
1
they
1
marched
1
away
2
until
2
they
1
came
1
near
2
to
1
Dorothy
3
Then
1
the
1
Lion
1
gave
1
a
1
great
2
roar
1
and
1
sprang
1
towards
2
them
1
and
1
the
1
poor
1
Winkies
2
were
1
so
1
frightened
2
that
1
they
1
ran
1
back
1
as
1
fast
1
as
1
they
1
could
1
When
1
they
1
returned
2
to
1
the
1
castle
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
beat
2
them
1
well
1
with
1
a
1
strap
1
and
1
sent
1
them
1
back
1
to
1
their
1
work
1
after
2
which
1
she
0
sat
1
down
1
to
1
think
1
what
1
she
0
should
1
do
1
next
1
She
0
could
1
not
1
understand
3
how
1
all
1
her
1
plans
1
to
1
destroy
2
these
1
strangers
2
had
1
failed
1
but
1
she
0
was
1
a
1
powerful
3
Witch
1
as
1
well
1
as
1
a
1
wicked
1
one
1
and
1
she
0
soon
1
made
1
up
1
her
1
mind
1
how
1
to
1
act
1
There
1
was
1
in
1
her
1
cupboard
2
a
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
with
1
a
1
circle
1
of
1
diamonds
3
and
1
rubies
2
running
2
round
1
it
1
This
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
had
1
a
1
charm
1
Whoever
2
owned
1
it
1
could
1
call
1
three
1
times
1
upon
2
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
who
1
would
1
obey
2
any
2
order
2
they
1
were
1
given
2
But
1
no
1
person
2
could
1
command
2
these
1
strange
1
creatures
3
more
1
than
1
three
1
times
1
Twice
1
already
4
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
had
1
used
1
the
1
charm
1
of
1
the
1
Cap
1
Once
1
was
1
when
1
she
0
had
1
made
1
the
1
Winkies
2
her
1
slaves
1
and
1
set
1
herself
2
to
1
rule
1
over
2
their
1
country
2
The
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
had
1
helped
1
her
1
do
1
this
1
The
1
second
2
time
1
was
1
when
1
she
0
had
1
fought
1
against
2
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
himself
2
and
1
driven
2
him
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
land
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
The
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
had
1
also
2
helped
1
her
1
in
1
doing
1
this
1
Only
2
once
1
more
1
could
1
she
0
use
1
this
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
for
1
which
1
reason
3
she
0
did
1
not
1
like
1
to
1
do
1
so
1
until
2
all
1
her
1
other
2
powers
2
were
1
exhausted
2
But
1
now
1
that
1
her
1
fierce
2
wolves
1
and
1
her
1
wild
1
crows
1
and
1
her
1
stinging
2
bees
0
were
1
gone
1
and
1
her
1
slaves
1
had
1
been
1
scared
1
away
2
by
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
she
0
saw
1
there
1
was
1
only
2
one
1
way
1
left
1
to
1
destroy
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
friends
2
So
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
took
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
from
1
her
1
cupboard
2
and
1
placed
1
it
1
upon
2
her
1
head
2
Then
1
she
0
stood
1
upon
2
her
1
left
1
foot
1
and
1
said
1
slowly
2
Ep-pe
1
pep-pe
1
kak-ke
1
Next
1
she
0
stood
1
upon
2
her
1
right
1
foot
1
and
1
said
1
Hil-lo
2
hol-lo
2
hel-lo
2
After
2
this
1
she
0
stood
1
upon
2
both
1
feet
1
and
1
cried
1
in
1
a
1
loud
1
voice
1
Ziz-zy
2
zuz-zy
2
zik
1
Now
1
the
1
charm
1
began
2
to
1
work
1
The
1
sky
1
was
1
darkened
2
and
1
a
1
low
1
rumbling
2
sound
1
was
1
heard
2
in
1
the
1
air
1
There
1
was
1
a
1
rushing
2
of
1
many
2
wings
1
a
1
great
2
chattering
3
and
1
laughing
2
and
1
the
1
sun
1
came
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
dark
1
sky
1
to
1
show
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
surrounded
2
by
1
a
1
crowd
1
of
1
monkeys
2
each
2
with
1
a
1
pair
1
of
1
immense
2
and
1
powerful
3
wings
1
on
1
his
1
shoulders
2
One
1
much
1
bigger
2
than
1
the
1
others
2
seemed
1
to
1
be
1
their
1
leader
3
He
1
flew
1
close
1
to
1
the
1
Witch
1
and
1
said
1
You
1
have
1
called
1
us
1
for
1
the
1
third
1
and
1
last
1
time
1
What
1
do
1
you
1
command
2
Go
1
to
1
the
1
strangers
2
who
1
are
1
within
2
my
1
land
1
and
1
destroy
2
them
1
all
1
except
2
the
1
Lion
1
said
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
Bring
1
that
1
beast
2
to
1
me
1
for
1
I
1
have
1
a
1
mind
1
to
1
harness
2
him
1
like
1
a
1
horse
1
and
1
make
1
him
1
work
1
Your
1
commands
2
shall
1
be
1
obeyed
1
said
1
the
1
leader
3
Then
1
with
1
a
1
great
2
deal
2
of
1
chattering
3
and
1
noise
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
flew
1
away
2
to
1
the
1
place
1
where
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
friends
2
were
1
walking
2
Some
1
of
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
seized
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
carried
2
him
1
through
1
the
1
air
1
until
2
they
1
were
1
over
2
a
1
country
2
thickly
2
covered
2
with
1
sharp
1
rocks
1
Here
1
they
1
dropped
1
the
1
poor
1
Woodman
2
who
1
fell
1
a
1
great
2
distance
2
to
1
the
1
rocks
1
where
1
he
1
lay
1
so
1
battered
2
and
1
dented
1
that
1
he
1
could
1
neither
2
move
1
nor
1
groan
1
Others
2
of
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
caught
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
with
1
their
1
long
1
fingers
2
pulled
1
all
1
of
1
the
1
straw
1
out
1
of
1
his
1
clothes
1
and
1
head
2
They
1
made
1
his
1
hat
1
and
1
boots
1
and
1
clothes
1
into
2
a
1
small
1
bundle
1
and
1
threw
1
it
1
into
2
the
1
top
1
branches
1
of
1
a
1
tall
1
tree
1
The
1
remaining
3
Monkeys
2
threw
1
pieces
2
of
1
stout
1
rope
1
around
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
wound
1
many
2
coils
1
about
2
his
1
body
2
and
1
head
2
and
1
legs
1
until
2
he
1
was
1
unable
2
to
1
bite
1
or
1
scratch
1
or
1
struggle
1
in
1
any
2
way
1
Then
1
they
1
lifted
1
him
1
up
1
and
1
flew
1
away
2
with
1
him
1
to
1
the
1
Witch
1
's
0
castle
1
where
1
he
1
was
1
placed
1
in
1
a
1
small
1
yard
2
with
1
a
1
high
1
iron
2
fence
1
around
2
it
1
so
1
that
1
he
1
could
1
not
1
escape
2
But
1
Dorothy
3
they
1
did
1
not
1
harm
1
at
1
all
1
She
0
stood
1
with
1
Toto
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
watching
2
the
1
sad
1
fate
1
of
1
her
1
comrades
2
and
1
thinking
2
it
1
would
1
soon
1
be
1
her
1
turn
1
The
1
leader
3
of
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
flew
1
up
1
to
1
her
1
his
1
long
1
hairy
2
arms
1
stretched
1
out
1
and
1
his
1
ugly
2
face
1
grinning
2
terribly
3
but
1
he
1
saw
1
the
1
mark
1
of
1
the
1
Good
1
Witch
1
's
0
kiss
1
upon
2
her
1
forehead
4
and
1
stopped
1
short
1
motioning
3
the
1
others
2
not
1
to
1
touch
1
her
1
We
1
dare
1
not
1
harm
1
this
1
little
1
girl
1
he
1
said
1
to
1
them
1
for
1
she
0
is
1
protected
2
by
1
the
1
Power
2
of
1
Good
1
and
1
that
1
is
1
greater
3
than
1
the
1
Power
2
of
1
Evil
2
All
1
we
1
can
1
do
1
is
1
to
1
carry
2
her
1
to
1
the
1
castle
1
of
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
and
1
leave
2
her
1
there
1
So
1
carefully
4
and
1
gently
2
they
1
lifted
1
Dorothy
3
in
1
their
1
arms
1
and
1
carried
2
her
1
swiftly
2
through
1
the
1
air
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
castle
1
where
1
they
1
set
1
her
1
down
1
upon
2
the
1
front
1
doorstep
2
Then
1
the
1
leader
3
said
1
to
1
the
1
Witch
1
We
1
have
1
obeyed
1
you
1
as
1
far
1
as
1
we
1
were
1
able
1
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
are
1
destroyed
1
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
is
1
tied
1
up
1
in
1
your
1
yard
2
The
1
little
1
girl
1
we
1
dare
1
not
1
harm
1
nor
1
the
1
dog
1
she
0
carries
2
in
1
her
1
arms
1
Your
1
power
2
over
2
our
1
band
1
is
1
now
1
ended
1
and
1
you
1
will
1
never
2
see
1
us
1
again
2
Then
1
all
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
with
1
much
1
laughing
2
and
1
chattering
3
and
1
noise
1
flew
1
into
2
the
1
air
1
and
1
were
1
soon
1
out
1
of
1
sight
1
The
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
was
1
both
1
surprised
2
and
1
worried
2
when
1
she
0
saw
1
the
1
mark
1
on
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
forehead
4
for
1
she
0
knew
1
well
1
that
1
neither
2
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
nor
1
she
0
herself
2
dare
1
hurt
1
the
1
girl
1
in
1
any
2
way
1
She
0
looked
1
down
1
at
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
feet
1
and
1
seeing
1
the
1
Silver
2
Shoes
0
began
2
to
1
tremble
1
with
1
fear
2
for
1
she
0
knew
1
what
1
a
1
powerful
3
charm
1
belonged
2
to
1
them
1
At
1
first
1
the
1
Witch
1
was
1
tempted
1
to
1
run
1
away
2
from
1
Dorothy
3
but
1
she
0
happened
2
to
1
look
1
into
2
the
1
child
1
's
0
eyes
0
and
1
saw
1
how
1
simple
1
the
1
soul
1
behind
2
them
1
was
1
and
1
that
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
did
1
not
1
know
1
of
1
the
1
wonderful
3
power
2
the
1
Silver
2
Shoes
0
gave
1
her
1
So
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
laughed
1
to
1
herself
2
and
1
thought
1
I
1
can
1
still
1
make
1
her
1
my
1
slave
1
for
1
she
0
does
0
not
1
know
1
how
1
to
1
use
1
her
1
power
2
Then
1
she
0
said
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
harshly
2
and
1
severely
4
Come
1
with
1
me
1
and
1
see
1
that
1
you
1
mind
1
everything
4
I
1
tell
1
you
1
for
1
if
1
you
1
do
1
not
1
I
1
will
1
make
1
an
1
end
1
of
1
you
1
as
1
I
1
did
1
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Dorothy
3
followed
2
her
1
through
1
many
2
of
1
the
1
beautiful
4
rooms
1
in
1
her
1
castle
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
kitchen
2
where
1
the
1
Witch
1
bade
1
her
1
clean
2
the
1
pots
1
and
1
kettles
1
and
1
sweep
1
the
1
floor
1
and
1
keep
1
the
1
fire
1
fed
0
with
1
wood
1
Dorothy
3
went
1
to
1
work
1
meekly
2
with
1
her
1
mind
1
made
1
up
1
to
1
work
1
as
1
hard
1
as
1
she
0
could
1
for
1
she
0
was
1
glad
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
had
1
decided
2
not
1
to
1
kill
1
her
1
With
1
Dorothy
3
hard
1
at
1
work
1
the
1
Witch
1
thought
1
she
0
would
1
go
1
into
2
the
1
courtyard
3
and
1
harness
2
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
like
1
a
1
horse
1
it
1
would
1
amuse
2
her
1
she
0
was
1
sure
1
to
1
make
1
him
1
draw
1
her
1
chariot
2
whenever
3
she
0
wished
1
to
1
go
1
to
1
drive
1
But
1
as
1
she
0
opened
2
the
1
gate
1
the
1
Lion
1
gave
1
a
1
loud
1
roar
1
and
1
bounded
1
at
1
her
1
so
1
fiercely
4
that
1
the
1
Witch
1
was
1
afraid
2
and
1
ran
1
out
1
and
1
shut
1
the
1
gate
1
again
2
If
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
harness
2
you
1
said
1
the
1
Witch
1
to
1
the
1
Lion
1
speaking
3
through
1
the
1
bars
1
of
1
the
1
gate
1
I
1
can
1
starve
1
you
1
You
1
shall
1
have
1
nothing
2
to
1
eat
2
until
2
you
1
do
1
as
1
I
1
wish
1
So
1
after
2
that
1
she
0
took
1
no
1
food
1
to
1
the
1
imprisoned
3
Lion
1
but
1
every
3
day
1
she
0
came
1
to
1
the
1
gate
1
at
1
noon
1
and
1
asked
1
Are
1
you
1
ready
3
to
1
be
1
harnessed
2
like
1
a
1
horse
1
And
1
the
1
Lion
1
would
1
answer
2
No
1
If
1
you
1
come
1
in
1
this
1
yard
2
I
1
will
1
bite
1
you
1
The
1
reason
3
the
1
Lion
1
did
1
not
1
have
1
to
1
do
1
as
1
the
1
Witch
1
wished
1
was
1
that
1
every
3
night
1
while
1
the
1
woman
2
was
1
asleep
2
Dorothy
3
carried
2
him
1
food
1
from
1
the
1
cupboard
2
After
2
he
1
had
1
eaten
3
he
1
would
1
lie
1
down
1
on
1
his
1
bed
0
of
1
straw
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
would
1
lie
1
beside
2
him
1
and
1
put
1
her
1
head
2
on
1
his
1
soft
1
shaggy
2
mane
1
while
1
they
1
talked
1
of
1
their
1
troubles
1
and
1
tried
1
to
1
plan
1
some
1
way
1
to
1
escape
2
But
1
they
1
could
1
find
1
no
1
way
1
to
1
get
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
castle
1
for
1
it
1
was
1
constantly
3
guarded
1
by
1
the
1
yellow
2
Winkies
2
who
1
were
1
the
1
slaves
1
of
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
and
1
too
1
afraid
2
of
1
her
1
not
1
to
1
do
1
as
1
she
0
told
1
them
1
The
1
girl
1
had
1
to
1
work
1
hard
1
during
2
the
1
day
1
and
1
often
2
the
1
Witch
1
threatened
3
to
1
beat
2
her
1
with
1
the
1
same
1
old
1
umbrella
3
she
0
always
2
carried
2
in
1
her
1
hand
1
But
1
in
1
truth
1
she
0
did
1
not
1
dare
1
to
1
strike
1
Dorothy
3
because
2
of
1
the
1
mark
1
upon
2
her
1
forehead
4
The
1
child
1
did
1
not
1
know
1
this
1
and
1
was
1
full
1
of
1
fear
2
for
1
herself
2
and
1
Toto
2
Once
1
the
1
Witch
1
struck
1
Toto
2
a
1
blow
1
with
1
her
1
umbrella
3
and
1
the
1
brave
1
little
1
dog
1
flew
1
at
1
her
1
and
1
bit
1
her
1
leg
1
in
1
return
2
The
1
Witch
1
did
1
not
1
bleed
0
where
1
she
0
was
1
bitten
2
for
1
she
0
was
1
so
1
wicked
1
that
1
the
1
blood
1
in
1
her
1
had
1
dried
1
up
1
many
2
years
2
before
2
Dorothy
3
's
0
life
1
became
2
very
2
sad
1
as
1
she
0
grew
1
to
1
understand
3
that
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
harder
2
than
1
ever
2
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
again
2
Sometimes
3
she
0
would
1
cry
1
bitterly
3
for
1
hours
1
with
1
Toto
2
sitting
2
at
1
her
1
feet
1
and
1
looking
2
into
2
her
1
face
1
whining
2
dismally
3
to
1
show
1
how
1
sorry
2
he
1
was
1
for
1
his
1
little
1
mistress
2
Toto
2
did
1
not
1
really
3
care
1
whether
2
he
1
was
1
in
1
Kansas
2
or
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
so
1
long
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
with
1
him
1
but
1
he
1
knew
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
was
1
unhappy
3
and
1
that
1
made
1
him
1
unhappy
3
too
1
Now
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
had
1
a
1
great
2
longing
2
to
1
have
1
for
1
her
1
own
1
the
1
Silver
2
Shoes
0
which
1
the
1
girl
1
always
2
wore
1
Her
1
bees
0
and
1
her
1
crows
1
and
1
her
1
wolves
1
were
1
lying
1
in
1
heaps
2
and
1
drying
1
up
1
and
1
she
0
had
1
used
1
up
1
all
1
the
1
power
2
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
but
1
if
1
she
0
could
1
only
2
get
1
hold
1
of
1
the
1
Silver
2
Shoes
0
they
1
would
1
give
1
her
1
more
1
power
2
than
1
all
1
the
1
other
2
things
1
she
0
had
1
lost
1
She
0
watched
1
Dorothy
3
carefully
4
to
1
see
1
if
1
she
0
ever
2
took
1
off
1
her
1
shoes
0
thinking
2
she
0
might
1
steal
2
them
1
But
1
the
1
child
1
was
1
so
1
proud
1
of
1
her
1
pretty
2
shoes
0
that
1
she
0
never
2
took
1
them
1
off
1
except
2
at
1
night
1
and
1
when
1
she
0
took
1
her
1
bath
1
The
1
Witch
1
was
1
too
1
much
1
afraid
2
of
1
the
1
dark
1
to
1
dare
1
go
1
in
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
room
1
at
1
night
1
to
1
take
1
the
1
shoes
0
and
1
her
1
dread
2
of
1
water
2
was
1
greater
3
than
1
her
1
fear
2
of
1
the
1
dark
1
so
1
she
0
never
2
came
1
near
2
when
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
bathing
2
Indeed
1
the
1
old
1
Witch
1
never
2
touched
1
water
2
nor
1
ever
2
let
1
water
2
touch
1
her
1
in
1
any
2
way
1
But
1
the
1
wicked
1
creature
3
was
1
very
2
cunning
2
and
1
she
0
finally
3
thought
1
of
1
a
1
trick
1
that
1
would
1
give
1
her
1
what
1
she
0
wanted
1
She
0
placed
1
a
1
bar
1
of
1
iron
2
in
1
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
kitchen
2
floor
1
and
1
then
1
by
1
her
1
magic
2
arts
1
made
1
the
1
iron
2
invisible
3
to
1
human
2
eyes
0
So
1
that
1
when
1
Dorothy
3
walked
1
across
2
the
1
floor
1
she
0
stumbled
1
over
2
the
1
bar
1
not
1
being
1
able
1
to
1
see
1
it
1
and
1
fell
1
at
1
full
1
length
1
She
0
was
1
not
1
much
1
hurt
1
but
1
in
1
her
1
fall
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
Silver
2
Shoes
0
came
1
off
1
and
1
before
2
she
0
could
1
reach
2
it
1
the
1
Witch
1
had
1
snatched
1
it
1
away
2
and
1
put
1
it
1
on
1
her
1
own
1
skinny
2
foot
1
The
1
wicked
1
woman
2
was
1
greatly
3
pleased
2
with
1
the
1
success
2
of
1
her
1
trick
1
for
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
she
0
had
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
shoes
0
she
0
owned
1
half
1
the
1
power
2
of
1
their
1
charm
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
could
1
not
1
use
1
it
1
against
2
her
1
even
2
had
1
she
0
known
1
how
1
to
1
do
1
so
1
The
1
little
1
girl
1
seeing
1
she
0
had
1
lost
1
one
1
of
1
her
1
pretty
2
shoes
0
grew
1
angry
2
and
1
said
1
to
1
the
1
Witch
1
Give
1
me
1
back
1
my
1
shoe
0
I
1
will
1
not
1
retorted
2
the
1
Witch
1
for
1
it
1
is
1
now
1
my
1
shoe
0
and
1
not
1
yours
1
You
1
are
1
a
1
wicked
1
creature
3
cried
1
Dorothy
3
You
1
have
1
no
1
right
1
to
1
take
1
my
1
shoe
0
from
1
me
1
I
1
shall
1
keep
1
it
1
just
1
the
1
same
1
said
1
the
1
Witch
1
laughing
2
at
1
her
1
and
1
someday
3
I
1
shall
1
get
1
the
1
other
2
one
1
from
1
you
1
too
1
This
1
made
1
Dorothy
3
so
1
very
2
angry
2
that
1
she
0
picked
1
up
1
the
1
bucket
2
of
1
water
2
that
1
stood
1
near
2
and
1
dashed
1
it
1
over
2
the
1
Witch
1
wetting
2
her
1
from
1
head
2
to
1
foot
1
Instantly
3
the
1
wicked
1
woman
2
gave
1
a
1
loud
1
cry
1
of
1
fear
2
and
1
then
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
looked
1
at
1
her
1
in
1
wonder
2
the
1
Witch
1
began
2
to
1
shrink
1
and
1
fall
1
away
2
See
1
what
1
you
1
have
1
done
1
she
0
screamed
2
In
1
a
1
minute
2
I
1
shall
1
melt
1
away
2
I
1
'm
0
very
2
sorry
2
indeed
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
who
1
was
1
truly
2
frightened
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
Witch
1
actually
3
melting
2
away
2
like
1
brown
1
sugar
2
before
2
her
1
very
2
eyes
0
Did
1
n't
0
you
1
know
1
water
2
would
1
be
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
me
1
asked
1
the
1
Witch
1
in
1
a
1
wailing
2
despairing
3
voice
1
Of
1
course
1
not
1
answered
2
Dorothy
3
How
1
should
1
I
1
Well
1
in
1
a
1
few
1
minutes
2
I
1
shall
1
be
1
all
1
melted
1
and
1
you
1
will
1
have
1
the
1
castle
1
to
1
yourself
2
I
1
have
1
been
1
wicked
1
in
1
my
1
day
1
but
1
I
1
never
2
thought
1
a
1
little
1
girl
1
like
1
you
1
would
1
ever
2
be
1
able
1
to
1
melt
1
me
1
and
1
end
1
my
1
wicked
1
deeds
1
Look
1
out
1
here
1
I
1
go
1
With
1
these
1
words
1
the
1
Witch
1
fell
1
down
1
in
1
a
1
brown
1
melted
1
shapeless
3
mass
1
and
1
began
2
to
1
spread
2
over
2
the
1
clean
2
boards
1
of
1
the
1
kitchen
2
floor
1
Seeing
1
that
1
she
0
had
1
really
3
melted
1
away
2
to
1
nothing
2
Dorothy
3
drew
1
another
3
bucket
2
of
1
water
2
and
1
threw
1
it
1
over
2
the
1
mess
1
She
0
then
1
swept
1
it
1
all
1
out
1
the
1
door
1
After
2
picking
2
out
1
the
1
silver
2
shoe
0
which
1
was
1
all
1
that
1
was
1
left
1
of
1
the
1
old
1
woman
2
she
0
cleaned
2
and
1
dried
1
it
1
with
1
a
1
cloth
1
and
1
put
1
it
1
on
1
her
1
foot
1
again
2
Then
1
being
1
at
1
last
1
free
1
to
1
do
1
as
1
she
0
chose
1
she
0
ran
1
out
1
to
1
the
1
courtyard
3
to
1
tell
1
the
1
Lion
1
that
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
had
1
come
1
to
1
an
1
end
1
and
1
that
1
they
1
were
1
no
1
longer
2
prisoners
3
in
1
a
1
strange
1
land
1
The
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
was
1
much
1
pleased
2
to
1
hear
2
that
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
had
1
been
1
melted
1
by
1
a
1
bucket
2
of
1
water
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
at
1
once
1
unlocked
2
the
1
gate
1
of
1
his
1
prison
2
and
1
set
1
him
1
free
1
They
1
went
1
in
1
together
3
to
1
the
1
castle
1
where
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
first
1
act
1
was
1
to
1
call
1
all
1
the
1
Winkies
2
together
3
and
1
tell
1
them
1
that
1
they
1
were
1
no
1
longer
2
slaves
1
There
1
was
1
great
2
rejoicing
3
among
2
the
1
yellow
2
Winkies
2
for
1
they
1
had
1
been
1
made
1
to
1
work
1
hard
1
during
2
many
2
years
2
for
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
who
1
had
1
always
2
treated
2
them
1
with
1
great
2
cruelty
2
They
1
kept
1
this
1
day
1
as
1
a
1
holiday
3
then
1
and
1
ever
2
after
2
and
1
spent
1
the
1
time
1
in
1
feasting
3
and
1
dancing
2
If
1
our
1
friends
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
were
1
only
2
with
1
us
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
should
1
be
1
quite
1
happy
2
Do
1
n't
0
you
1
suppose
2
we
1
could
1
rescue
1
them
1
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
anxiously
3
We
1
can
1
try
1
answered
2
the
1
Lion
1
So
1
they
1
called
1
the
1
yellow
2
Winkies
2
and
1
asked
1
them
1
if
1
they
1
would
1
help
1
to
1
rescue
1
their
1
friends
2
and
1
the
1
Winkies
2
said
1
that
1
they
1
would
1
be
1
delighted
2
to
1
do
1
all
1
in
1
their
1
power
2
for
1
Dorothy
3
who
1
had
1
set
1
them
1
free
1
from
1
bondage
2
So
1
she
0
chose
1
a
1
number
2
of
1
the
1
Winkies
2
who
1
looked
1
as
1
if
1
they
1
knew
1
the
1
most
1
and
1
they
1
all
1
started
1
away
2
They
1
traveled
2
that
1
day
1
and
1
part
1
of
1
the
1
next
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
rocky
2
plain
1
where
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
lay
1
all
1
battered
2
and
1
bent
1
His
1
axe
1
was
1
near
2
him
1
but
1
the
1
blade
1
was
1
rusted
1
and
1
the
1
handle
1
broken
2
off
1
short
1
The
1
Winkies
2
lifted
1
him
1
tenderly
3
in
1
their
1
arms
1
and
1
carried
2
him
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
Yellow
2
Castle
1
again
2
Dorothy
3
shedding
2
a
1
few
1
tears
2
by
1
the
1
way
1
at
1
the
1
sad
1
plight
1
of
1
her
1
old
1
friend
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
looking
2
sober
2
and
1
sorry
2
When
1
they
1
reached
2
the
1
castle
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
to
1
the
1
Winkies
2
Are
1
any
2
of
1
your
1
people
1
tinsmiths
2
Oh
1
yes
0
Some
1
of
1
us
1
are
1
very
2
good
1
tinsmiths
2
they
1
told
1
her
1
Then
1
bring
1
them
1
to
1
me
1
she
0
said
1
And
1
when
1
the
1
tinsmiths
2
came
1
bringing
2
with
1
them
1
all
1
their
1
tools
1
in
1
baskets
2
she
0
inquired
2
Can
1
you
1
straighten
2
out
1
those
1
dents
1
in
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
bend
1
him
1
back
1
into
2
shape
1
again
2
and
1
solder
2
him
1
together
3
where
1
he
1
is
1
broken
2
The
1
tinsmiths
2
looked
1
the
1
Woodman
2
over
2
carefully
4
and
1
then
1
answered
2
that
1
they
1
thought
1
they
1
could
1
mend
1
him
1
so
1
he
1
would
1
be
1
as
1
good
1
as
1
ever
2
So
1
they
1
set
1
to
1
work
1
in
1
one
1
of
1
the
1
big
1
yellow
2
rooms
1
of
1
the
1
castle
1
and
1
worked
1
for
1
three
1
days
1
and
1
four
1
nights
1
hammering
3
and
1
twisting
2
and
1
bending
2
and
1
soldering
3
and
1
polishing
3
and
1
pounding
2
at
1
the
1
legs
1
and
1
body
2
and
1
head
2
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
until
2
at
1
last
1
he
1
was
1
straightened
2
out
1
into
2
his
1
old
1
form
1
and
1
his
1
joints
1
worked
1
as
1
well
1
as
1
ever
2
To
1
be
1
sure
1
there
1
were
1
several
3
patches
1
on
1
him
1
but
1
the
1
tinsmiths
2
did
1
a
1
good
1
job
1
and
1
as
1
the
1
Woodman
2
was
1
not
1
a
1
vain
1
man
1
he
1
did
1
not
1
mind
1
the
1
patches
1
at
1
all
1
When
1
at
1
last
1
he
1
walked
1
into
2
Dorothy
3
's
0
room
1
and
1
thanked
1
her
1
for
1
rescuing
2
him
1
he
1
was
1
so
1
pleased
2
that
1
he
1
wept
1
tears
2
of
1
joy
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
had
1
to
1
wipe
1
every
3
tear
2
carefully
4
from
1
his
1
face
1
with
1
her
1
apron
2
so
1
his
1
joints
1
would
1
not
1
be
1
rusted
1
At
1
the
1
same
1
time
1
her
1
own
1
tears
2
fell
1
thick
1
and
1
fast
1
at
1
the
1
joy
1
of
1
meeting
2
her
1
old
1
friend
2
again
2
and
1
these
1
tears
2
did
1
not
1
need
0
to
1
be
1
wiped
1
away
2
As
1
for
1
the
1
Lion
1
he
1
wiped
1
his
1
eyes
0
so
1
often
2
with
1
the
1
tip
1
of
1
his
1
tail
1
that
1
it
1
became
2
quite
1
wet
1
and
1
he
1
was
1
obliged
2
to
1
go
1
out
1
into
2
the
1
courtyard
3
and
1
hold
1
it
1
in
1
the
1
sun
1
till
1
it
1
dried
1
If
1
we
1
only
2
had
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
with
1
us
1
again
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
when
1
Dorothy
3
had
1
finished
2
telling
2
him
1
everything
4
that
1
had
1
happened
2
I
1
should
1
be
1
quite
1
happy
2
We
1
must
1
try
1
to
1
find
1
him
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
So
1
she
0
called
1
the
1
Winkies
2
to
1
help
1
her
1
and
1
they
1
walked
1
all
1
that
1
day
1
and
1
part
1
of
1
the
1
next
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
tall
1
tree
1
in
1
the
1
branches
1
of
1
which
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
had
1
tossed
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
's
0
clothes
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
very
2
tall
1
tree
1
and
1
the
1
trunk
1
was
1
so
1
smooth
1
that
1
no
1
one
1
could
1
climb
1
it
1
but
1
the
1
Woodman
2
said
1
at
1
once
1
I
1
'll
0
chop
1
it
1
down
1
and
1
then
1
we
1
can
1
get
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
's
0
clothes
1
Now
1
while
1
the
1
tinsmiths
2
had
1
been
1
at
1
work
1
mending
2
the
1
Woodman
2
himself
2
another
3
of
1
the
1
Winkies
2
who
1
was
1
a
1
goldsmith
2
had
1
made
1
an
1
axe-handle
3
of
1
solid
2
gold
1
and
1
fitted
1
it
1
to
1
the
1
Woodman
2
's
0
axe
1
instead
3
of
1
the
1
old
1
broken
2
handle
1
Others
2
polished
2
the
1
blade
1
until
2
all
1
the
1
rust
1
was
1
removed
2
and
1
it
1
glistened
2
like
1
burnished
2
silver
2
As
1
soon
1
as
1
he
1
had
1
spoken
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
began
2
to
1
chop
1
and
1
in
1
a
1
short
1
time
1
the
1
tree
1
fell
1
over
2
with
1
a
1
crash
1
whereupon
3
the
1
Scarecrow
3
's
0
clothes
1
fell
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
branches
1
and
1
rolled
1
off
1
on
1
the
1
ground
1
Dorothy
3
picked
1
them
1
up
1
and
1
had
1
the
1
Winkies
2
carry
2
them
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
castle
1
where
1
they
1
were
1
stuffed
1
with
1
nice
1
clean
2
straw
1
and
1
behold
2
here
1
was
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
as
1
good
1
as
1
ever
2
thanking
2
them
1
over
2
and
1
over
2
again
2
for
1
saving
2
him
1
Now
1
that
1
they
1
were
1
reunited
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
friends
2
spent
1
a
1
few
1
happy
2
days
1
at
1
the
1
Yellow
2
Castle
1
where
1
they
1
found
1
everything
4
they
1
needed
1
to
1
make
1
them
1
comfortable
3
But
1
one
1
day
1
the
1
girl
1
thought
1
of
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
and
1
said
1
We
1
must
1
go
1
back
1
to
1
Oz
1
and
1
claim
1
his
1
promise
2
Yes
0
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
at
1
last
1
I
1
shall
1
get
1
my
1
heart
2
And
1
I
1
shall
1
get
1
my
1
brains
1
added
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
joyfully
3
And
1
I
1
shall
1
get
1
my
1
courage
2
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
thoughtfully
3
And
1
I
1
shall
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
cried
1
Dorothy
3
clapping
2
her
1
hands
1
Oh
1
let
1
us
1
start
1
for
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
tomorrow
3
This
1
they
1
decided
2
to
1
do
1
The
1
next
1
day
1
they
1
called
1
the
1
Winkies
2
together
3
and
1
bade
1
them
1
good-bye
1
The
1
Winkies
2
were
1
sorry
2
to
1
have
1
them
1
go
1
and
1
they
1
had
1
grown
1
so
1
fond
1
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
that
1
they
1
begged
1
him
1
to
1
stay
1
and
1
rule
1
over
2
them
1
and
1
the
1
Yellow
2
Land
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
Finding
2
they
1
were
1
determined
3
to
1
go
1
the
1
Winkies
2
gave
1
Toto
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
each
2
a
1
golden
2
collar
2
and
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
they
1
presented
2
a
1
beautiful
4
bracelet
3
studded
1
with
1
diamonds
3
and
1
to
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
they
1
gave
1
a
1
gold-headed
3
walking
2
stick
1
to
1
keep
1
him
1
from
1
stumbling
2
and
1
to
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
they
1
offered
2
a
1
silver
2
oil-can
2
inlaid
2
with
1
gold
1
and
1
set
1
with
1
precious
2
jewels
2
Every
3
one
1
of
1
the
1
travelers
3
made
1
the
1
Winkies
2
a
1
pretty
2
speech
1
in
1
return
2
and
1
all
1
shook
1
hands
1
with
1
them
1
until
2
their
1
arms
1
ached
1
Dorothy
3
went
1
to
1
the
1
Witch
1
's
0
cupboard
2
to
1
fill
1
her
1
basket
2
with
1
food
1
for
1
the
1
journey
2
and
1
there
1
she
0
saw
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
She
0
tried
1
it
1
on
1
her
1
own
1
head
2
and
1
found
1
that
1
it
1
fitted
1
her
1
exactly
3
She
0
did
1
not
1
know
1
anything
3
about
2
the
1
charm
1
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
but
1
she
0
saw
1
that
1
it
1
was
1
pretty
2
so
1
she
0
made
1
up
1
her
1
mind
1
to
1
wear
2
it
1
and
1
carry
2
her
1
sunbonnet
3
in
1
the
1
basket
2
Then
1
being
1
prepared
2
for
1
the
1
journey
2
they
1
all
1
started
1
for
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
the
1
Winkies
2
gave
1
them
1
three
1
cheers
1
and
1
many
2
good
1
wishes
1
to
1
carry
2
with
1
them
1
You
1
will
1
remember
3
there
1
was
1
no
1
road
1
not
1
even
2
a
1
pathway
2
between
2
the
1
castle
1
of
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
and
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
When
1
the
1
four
1
travelers
3
went
1
in
1
search
2
of
1
the
1
Witch
1
she
0
had
1
seen
1
them
1
coming
2
and
1
so
1
sent
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
to
1
bring
1
them
1
to
1
her
1
It
1
was
1
much
1
harder
2
to
1
find
1
their
1
way
1
back
1
through
1
the
1
big
1
fields
2
of
1
buttercups
3
and
1
yellow
2
daisies
2
than
1
it
1
was
1
being
1
carried
2
They
1
knew
1
of
1
course
1
they
1
must
1
go
1
straight
1
east
2
toward
2
the
1
rising
2
sun
1
and
1
they
1
started
1
off
1
in
1
the
1
right
1
way
1
But
1
at
1
noon
1
when
1
the
1
sun
1
was
1
over
2
their
1
heads
2
they
1
did
1
not
1
know
1
which
1
was
1
east
2
and
1
which
1
was
1
west
1
and
1
that
1
was
1
the
1
reason
3
they
1
were
1
lost
1
in
1
the
1
great
2
fields
2
They
1
kept
1
on
1
walking
2
however
3
and
1
at
1
night
1
the
1
moon
1
came
1
out
1
and
1
shone
1
brightly
2
So
1
they
1
lay
1
down
1
among
2
the
1
sweet
1
smelling
2
yellow
2
flowers
2
and
1
slept
1
soundly
2
until
2
morning
2
all
1
but
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
The
1
next
1
morning
2
the
1
sun
1
was
1
behind
2
a
1
cloud
1
but
1
they
1
started
1
on
1
as
1
if
1
they
1
were
1
quite
1
sure
1
which
1
way
1
they
1
were
1
going
1
If
1
we
1
walk
1
far
1
enough
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
I
1
am
1
sure
1
we
1
shall
1
sometime
3
come
1
to
1
some
1
place
1
But
1
day
1
by
1
day
1
passed
1
away
2
and
1
they
1
still
1
saw
1
nothing
2
before
2
them
1
but
1
the
1
scarlet
2
fields
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
began
2
to
1
grumble
1
a
1
bit
1
We
1
have
1
surely
3
lost
1
our
1
way
1
he
1
said
1
and
1
unless
2
we
1
find
1
it
1
again
2
in
1
time
1
to
1
reach
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
I
1
shall
1
never
2
get
1
my
1
brains
1
Nor
1
I
1
my
1
heart
2
declared
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
It
1
seems
1
to
1
me
1
I
1
can
1
scarcely
3
wait
1
till
1
I
1
get
1
to
1
Oz
1
and
1
you
1
must
1
admit
2
this
1
is
1
a
1
very
2
long
1
journey
2
You
1
see
1
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
with
1
a
1
whimper
2
I
1
have
1
n't
0
the
1
courage
2
to
1
keep
1
tramping
2
forever
3
without
2
getting
2
anywhere
3
at
1
all
1
Then
1
Dorothy
3
lost
1
heart
2
She
0
sat
1
down
1
on
1
the
1
grass
1
and
1
looked
1
at
1
her
1
companions
3
and
1
they
1
sat
1
down
1
and
1
looked
1
at
1
her
1
and
1
Toto
2
found
1
that
1
for
1
the
1
first
1
time
1
in
1
his
1
life
1
he
1
was
1
too
1
tired
1
to
1
chase
1
a
1
butterfly
3
that
1
flew
1
past
1
his
1
head
2
So
1
he
1
put
1
out
1
his
1
tongue
1
and
1
panted
1
and
1
looked
1
at
1
Dorothy
3
as
1
if
1
to
1
ask
1
what
1
they
1
should
1
do
1
next
1
Suppose
2
we
1
call
1
the
1
field
2
mice
1
she
0
suggested
2
They
1
could
1
probably
3
tell
1
us
1
the
1
way
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
To
1
be
1
sure
1
they
1
could
1
cried
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Why
1
did
1
n't
0
we
1
think
1
of
1
that
1
before
2
Dorothy
3
blew
1
the
1
little
1
whistle
1
she
0
had
1
always
2
carried
2
about
2
her
1
neck
1
since
1
the
1
Queen
1
of
1
the
1
Mice
1
had
1
given
2
it
1
to
1
her
1
In
1
a
1
few
1
minutes
2
they
1
heard
2
the
1
pattering
3
of
1
tiny
2
feet
1
and
1
many
2
of
1
the
1
small
1
gray
1
mice
1
came
1
running
2
up
1
to
1
her
1
Among
2
them
1
was
1
the
1
Queen
1
herself
2
who
1
asked
1
in
1
her
1
squeaky
3
little
1
voice
1
What
1
can
1
I
1
do
1
for
1
my
1
friends
2
We
1
have
1
lost
1
our
1
way
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
Can
1
you
1
tell
1
us
1
where
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
is
1
Certainly
3
answered
2
the
1
Queen
1
but
1
it
1
is
1
a
1
great
2
way
1
off
1
for
1
you
1
have
1
had
1
it
1
at
1
your
1
backs
1
all
1
this
1
time
1
Then
1
she
0
noticed
2
Dorothy's
3
Golden
2
Cap
1
and

you
1
use

the

charm

the

the

to

I

there

Dorothy

in
1
surprise

What

is
1
it
1
It

the

the

if

to

1
the

Winged
1
Monkeys
2
we

must
1
run
1
away
2
for
1
they
1
are
1
full
1
of

mischief
3
and

think
1
it
1
great
2
fun
1
to

plague

us

Wo

they

me

asked

the

anxiously

Oh

no

They

the

wearer

of

the

Good-bye

And

she

out
1
of

sight

with

all
1
the

mice
1

after

Dorothy

looked

inside
2
the

Cap

saw
1
some

words

written

upon
2
the

lining
2
These
1
she
0
thought

must

be
1
the

charm
1
so
1
she
0
read
2
the
1
directions
3
carefully
4
and
1
put

the

Cap

upon

her

did

you

the

Scarecrow

Dorothy

on

her

This

ended
1
the
1
saying
1
of
1
the
1
charm
1
and
1
they
1
heard
2
a
1
great
2
chattering
3
and
1
flapping
2
of
1
wings
1
as
1
the
1
band
1
of
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
flew
1
up
1
to
1
them
1
The
1
King
1
bowed
1
low
1
before
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
asked
1
What
1
is
1
your
1
command
2
We
1
wish
1
to
1
go
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
said
1
the
1
child
1
and
1
we
1
have
1
lost
1
our
1
way
1
We
1
will
1
carry
2
you
1
replied
2
the
1
King
1
and
1
no
1
sooner
2
had
1
he
1
spoken
2
than
1
two
1
of
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
caught
1
Dorothy
3
in
1
their
1
arms
1
and
1
flew
1
away
2
with
1
her
1
Others
2
took
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
one
1
little
1
Monkey
2
seized
1
Toto
2
and
1
flew
1
after
2
them
1
although
2
the
1
dog
1
tried
1
hard
1
to
1
bite
1
him
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
were
1
rather
2
frightened
2
at
1
first
1
for
1
they
1
remembered
3
how
1
badly
2
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
had
1
treated
2
them
1
before
2
but
1
they
1
saw
1
that
1
no
1
harm
1
was
1
intended
2
so
1
they
1
rode
1
through
1
the
1
air
1
quite
1
cheerfully
3
and
1
had
1
a
1
fine
1
time
1
looking
2
at
1
the
1
pretty
2
gardens
2
and
1
woods
1
far
1
below
2
them
1
Dorothy
3
found
1
herself
2
riding
2
easily
4
between
2
two
1
of
1
the
1
biggest
2
Monkeys
2
one
1
of
1
them
1
the
1
King
1
himself
2
They
1
had
1
made
1
a
1
chair
1
of
1
their
1
hands
1
and
1
were
1
careful
3
not
1
to
1
hurt
1
her
1
Why
1
do
1
you
1
have
1
to
1
obey
2
the
1
charm
1
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
she
0
asked
1
That
1
is
1
a
1
long
1
story
2
answered
2
the
1
King
1
with
1
a
1
winged
1
laugh
1
but
1
as
1
we
1
have
1
a
1
long
1
journey
2
before
2
us
1
I
1
will
1
pass
1
the
1
time
1
by
1
telling
2
you
1
about
2
it
1
if
1
you
1
wish
1
I
1
shall
1
be
1
glad
1
to
1
hear
2
it
1
she
0
replied
2
Once
1
began
2
the
1
leader
3
we
1
were
1
a
1
free
1
people
1
living
2
happily
3
in
1
the
1
great
2
forest
2
flying
1
from
1
tree
1
to
1
tree
1
eating
3
nuts
1
and
1
fruit
1
and
1
doing
1
just
1
as
1
we
1
pleased
2
without
2
calling
2
anybody
4
master
2
Perhaps
2
some
1
of
1
us
1
were
1
rather
2
too
1
full
1
of
1
mischief
3
at
1
times
1
flying
1
down
1
to
1
pull
1
the
1
tails
1
of
1
the
1
animals
3
that
1
had
1
no
1
wings
1
chasing
2
birds
1
and
1
throwing
2
nuts
1
at
1
the
1
people
1
who
1
walked
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
But
1
we
1
were
1
careless
3
and
1
happy
2
and
1
full
1
of
1
fun
1
and
1
enjoyed
1
every
3
minute
2
of
1
the
1
day
1
This
1
was
1
many
2
years
2
ago
2
long
1
before
2
Oz
1
came
1
out
1
of
1
the
1
clouds
1
to
1
rule
1
over
2
this
1
land
1
There
1
lived
1
here
1
then
1
away
2
at
1
the
1
North
1
a
1
beautiful
4
princess
2
who
1
was
1
also
2
a
1
powerful
3
sorceress
3
All
1
her
1
magic
2
was
1
used
1
to
1
help
1
the
1
people
1
and
1
she
0
was
1
never
2
known
1
to
1
hurt
1
anyone
2
who
1
was
1
good
1
Her
1
name
1
was
1
Gayelette
2
and
1
she
0
lived
1
in
1
a
1
handsome
2
palace
2
built
1
from
1
great
2
blocks
1
of
1
ruby
2
Everyone
3
loved
1
her
1
but
1
her
1
greatest
3
sorrow
2
was
1
that
1
she
0
could
1
find
1
no
1
one
1
to
1
love
1
in
1
return
2
since
1
all
1
the
1
men
1
were
1
much
1
too
1
stupid
2
and
1
ugly
2
to
1
mate
1
with
1
one
1
so
1
beautiful
4
and
1
wise
1
At
1
last
1
however
3
she
0
found
1
a
1
boy
1
who
1
was
1
handsome
2
and
1
manly
2
and
1
wise
1
beyond
1
his
1
years
2
Gayelette
2
made
1
up
1
her
1
mind
1
that
1
when
1
he
1
grew
1
to
1
be
1
a
1
man
1
she
0
would
1
make
1
him
1
her
1
husband
2
so
1
she
0
took
1
him
1
to
1
her
1
ruby
2
palace
2
and
1
used
1
all
1
her
1
magic
2
powers
2
to
1
make
1
him
1
as
1
strong
1
and
1
good
1
and
1
lovely
3
as
1
any
2
woman
2
could
1
wish
1
When
1
he
1
grew
1
to
1
manhood
2
Quelala
3
as
1
he
1
was
1
called
1
was
1
said
1
to
1
be
1
the
1
best
1
and
1
wisest
2
man
1
in
1
all
1
the
1
land
1
while
1
his
1
manly
2
beauty
3
was
1
so
1
great
2
that
1
Gayelette
2
loved
1
him
1
dearly
3
and
1
hastened
2
to
1
make
1
everything
4
ready
3
for
1
the
1
wedding
2
My
1
grandfather
3
was
1
at
1
that
1
time
1
the
1
King
1
of
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
which
1
lived
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
near
2
Gayelette
2
's
0
palace
2
and
1
the
1
old
1
fellow
2
loved
1
a
1
joke
1
better
2
than
1
a
1
good
1
dinner
2
One
1
day
1
just
1
before
2
the
1
wedding
2
my
1
grandfather
3
was
1
flying
1
out
1
with
1
his
1
band
1
when
1
he
1
saw
1
Quelala
3
walking
2
beside
2
the
1
river
2
He
1
was
1
dressed
1
in
1
a
1
rich
1
costume
2
of
1
pink
1
silk
1
and
1
purple
1
velvet
2
and
1
my
1
grandfather
3
thought
1
he
1
would
1
see
1
what
1
he
1
could
1
do
1
At
1
his
1
word
1
the
1
band
1
flew
1
down
1
and
1
seized
1
Quelala
3
carried
2
him
1
in
1
their
1
arms
1
until
2
they
1
were
1
over
2
the
1
middle
1
of
1
the
1
river
2
and
1
then
1
dropped
1
him
1
into
2
the
1
water
2
'Swim
1
out
1
my
1
fine
1
fellow
2
cried
1
my
1
grandfather
3
'and
1
see
1
if
1
the
1
water
2
has
1
spotted
1
your
1
clothes
1
Quelala
3
was
1
much
1
too
1
wise
1
not
1
to
1
swim
1
and
1
he
1
was
1
not
1
in
1
the
1
least
2
spoiled
1
by
1
all
1
his
1
good
1
fortune
2
He
1
laughed
1
when
1
he
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
water
2
and
1
swam
1
in
1
to
1
shore
1
But
1
when
1
Gayelette
2
came
1
running
2
out
1
to
1
him
1
she
0
found
1
his
1
silks
1
and
1
velvet
2
all
1
ruined
1
by
1
the
1
river
2
The
1
princess
2
was
1
angry
2
and
1
she
0
knew
1
of
1
course
1
who
1
did
1
it
1
She
0
had
1
all
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
brought
1
before
2
her
1
and
1
she
0
said
1
at
1
first
1
that
1
their
1
wings
1
should
1
be
1
tied
1
and
1
they
1
should
1
be
1
treated
2
as
1
they
1
had
1
treated
2
Quelala
3
and
1
dropped
1
in
1
the
1
river
2
But
1
my
1
grandfather
3
pleaded
2
hard
1
for
1
he
1
knew
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
would
1
drown
1
in
1
the
1
river
2
with
1
their
1
wings
1
tied
1
and
1
Quelala
3
said
1
a
1
kind
1
word
1
for
1
them
1
also
2
so
1
that
1
Gayelette
2
finally
3
spared
1
them
1
on
1
condition
3
that
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
should
1
ever
2
after
2
do
1
three
1
times
1
the
1
bidding
2
of
1
the
1
owner
2
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
This
1
Cap
1
had
1
been
1
made
1
for
1
a
1
wedding
2
present
2
to
1
Quelala
3
and
1
it
1
is
1
said
1
to
1
have
1
cost
1
the
1
princess
2
half
1
her
1
kingdom
2
Of
1
course
1
my
1
grandfather
3
and
1
all
1
the
1
other
2
Monkeys
2
at
1
once
1
agreed
1
to
1
the
1
condition
3
and
1
that
1
is
1
how
1
it
1
happens
2
that
1
we
1
are
1
three
1
times
1
the
1
slaves
1
of
1
the
1
owner
2
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
whosoever
3
he
1
may
1
be
1
And
1
what
1
became
2
of
1
them
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
who
1
had
1
been
1
greatly
3
interested
3
in
1
the
1
story
2
Quelala
3
being
1
the
1
first
1
owner
2
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
replied
2
the
1
Monkey
2
he
1
was
1
the
1
first
1
to
1
lay
1
his
1
wishes
1
upon
2
us
1
As
1
his
1
bride
1
could
1
not
1
bear
2
the
1
sight
1
of
1
us
1
he
1
called
1
us
1
all
1
to
1
him
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
after
2
he
1
had
1
married
2
her
1
and
1
ordered
2
us
1
always
2
to
1
keep
1
where
1
she
0
could
1
never
2
again
2
set
1
eyes
0
on
1
a
1
Winged
1
Monkey
2
which
1
we
1
were
1
glad
1
to
1
do
1
for
1
we
1
were
1
all
1
afraid
2
of
1
her
1
This
1
was
1
all
1
we
1
ever
2
had
1
to
1
do
1
until
2
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
fell
1
into
2
the
1
hands
1
of
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
who
1
made
1
us
1
enslave
2
the
1
Winkies
2
and
1
afterward
3
drive
1
Oz
1
himself
2
out
1
of
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
Now
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
is
1
yours
1
and
1
three
1
times
1
you
1
have
1
the
1
right
1
to
1
lay
1
your
1
wishes
1
upon
2
us
1
As
1
the
1
Monkey
2
King
1
finished
2
his
1
story
2
Dorothy
3
looked
1
down
1
and
1
saw
1
the
1
green
1
shining
2
walls
1
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
before
2
them
1
She
0
wondered
2
at
1
the
1
rapid
2
flight
1
of
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
but
1
was
1
glad
1
the
1
journey
2
was
1
over
2
The
1
strange
1
creatures
3
set
1
the
1
travelers
3
down
1
carefully
4
before
2
the
1
gate
1
of
1
the
1
City
2
the
1
King
1
bowed
1
low
1
to
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
then
1
flew
1
swiftly
2
away
2
followed
2
by
1
all
1
his
1
band
1
That
1
was
1
a
1
good
1
ride
1
said
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
Yes
0
and
1
a
1
quick
1
way
1
out
1
of
1
our
1
troubles
1
replied
2
the
1
Lion
1
How
1
lucky
2
it
1
was
1
you
1
brought
1
away
2
that
1
wonderful
3
Cap
1
The
1
four
1
travelers
3
walked
1
up
1
to
1
the
1
great
2
gate
1
of
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
rang
1
the
1
bell
1
After
2
ringing
2
several
3
times
1
it
1
was
1
opened
2
by
1
the
1
same
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
they
1
had
1
met
1
before
2
What
1
are
1
you
1
back
1
again
2
he
1
asked
1
in
1
surprise
2
Do
1
you
1
not
1
see
1
us
1
answered
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
But
1
I
1
thought
1
you
1
had
1
gone
1
to
1
visit
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
We
1
did
1
visit
2
her
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
And
1
she
0
let
1
you
1
go
1
again
2
asked
1
the
1
man
1
in
1
wonder
2
She
0
could
1
not
1
help
1
it
1
for
1
she
0
is
1
melted
1
explained
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Melted
1
Well
1
that
1
is
1
good
1
news
1
indeed
1
said
1
the
1
man
1
Who
1
melted
1
her
1
It
1
was
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
gravely
3
Good
1
gracious
2
exclaimed
2
the
1
man
1
and
1
he
1
bowed
1
very
2
low
1
indeed
1
before
2
her
1
Then
1
he
1
led
0
them
1
into
2
his
1
little
1
room
1
and
1
locked
1
the
1
spectacles
2
from
1
the
1
great
2
box
1
on
1
all
1
their
1
eyes
0
just
1
as
1
he
1
had
1
done
1
before
2
Afterward
3
they
1
passed
1
on
1
through
1
the
1
gate
1
into
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
When
1
the
1
people
1
heard
2
from
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gates
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
had
1
melted
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
they
1
all
1
gathered
2
around
2
the
1
travelers
3
and
1
followed
2
them
1
in
1
a
1
great
2
crowd
1
to
1
the
1
Palace
2
of
1
Oz
1
The
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
was
1
still
1
on
1
guard
1
before
2
the
1
door
1
but
1
he
1
let
1
them
1
in
1
at
1
once
1
and
1
they
1
were
1
again
2
met
1
by
1
the
1
beautiful
4
green
1
girl
1
who
1
showed
1
each
2
of
1
them
1
to
1
their
1
old
1
rooms
1
at
1
once
1
so
1
they
1
might
1
rest
1
until
2
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
was
1
ready
3
to
1
receive
2
them
1
The
1
soldier
3
had
1
the
1
news
1
carried
2
straight
1
to
1
Oz
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
other
2
travelers
3
had
1
come
1
back
1
again
2
after
2
destroying
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
but
1
Oz
1
made
1
no
1
reply
2
They
1
thought
1
the
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
would
1
send
1
for
1
them
1
at
1
once
1
but
1
he
1
did
1
not
1
They
1
had
1
no
1
word
1
from
1
him
1
the
1
next
1
day
1
nor
1
the
1
next
1
nor
1
the
1
next
1
The
1
waiting
2
was
1
tiresome
3
and
1
wearing
3
and
1
at
1
last
1
they
1
grew
1
vexed
1
that
1
Oz
1
should
1
treat
2
them
1
in
1
so
1
poor
1
a
1
fashion
2
after
2
sending
2
them
1
to
1
undergo
3
hardships
2
and
1
slavery
3
So
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
at
1
last
1
asked
1
the
1
green
1
girl
1
to
1
take
1
another
3
message
2
to
1
Oz
1
saying
1
if
1
he
1
did
1
not
1
let
1
them
1
in
1
to
1
see
1
him
1
at
1
once
1
they
1
would
1
call
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
to
1
help
1
them
1
and
1
find
1
out
1
whether
2
he
1
kept
1
his
1
promises
2
or
1
not
1
When
1
the
1
Wizard
2
was
1
given
2
this
1
message
2
he
1
was
1
so
1
frightened
2
that
1
he
1
sent
1
word
1
for
1
them
1
to
1
come
1
to
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
at
1
four
1
minutes
2
after
2
nine
1
o'clock
2
the
1
next
1
morning
2
He
1
had
1
once
1
met
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
in
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
the
1
West
1
and
1
he
1
did
1
not
1

The
1
four
1
travelers
3
passed
1
a
1
sleepless
2
night
1
each
2
thinking
2
of
1
the
1
gift
1
Oz
1
had
1
promised
2
to
1
bestow
2
on
1
him
1
Dorothy
3
fell
1
asleep
2
only
2
once
1
and
1
then
1
she
0
dreamed
2
she
0
was
1
in
1
Kansas
2
where
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
was
1
telling
2
her
1
how
1
glad
1
she
0
was
1
to
1
have
1
her
1
little
1
girl
1
at
1
home
1
again
2
Promptly
2
at
1
nine
1
o'clock
2
the
1
next
1
morning
2
the
1
green-whiskered
3
soldier
3
came
1
to
1
them
1
and
1
four
1
minutes
2
later
2
they
1
all
1
went
1
into
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
of
1
the
1
Great
2
Oz
1
Of
1
course
1
each
2
one
1
of
1
them
1
expected
2
to
1
see
1
the
1
Wizard
2
in
1
the
1
shape
1
he
1
had
1
taken
2
before
2
and
1
all
1
were
1
greatly
3
surprised
2
when
1
they
1
looked
1
about
2
and
1
saw
1
no
1
one
1
at
1
all
1
in
1
the
1
room
1
They
1
kept
1
close
1
to
1
the
1
door
1
and
1
closer
2
to
1
one
1
another
3
for
1
the
1
stillness
2
of
1
the
1
empty
2
room
1
was
1
more
1
dreadful
3
than
1
any
2
of
1
the
1
forms
1
they
1
had
1
seen
1
Oz
1
take
1
Presently
3
they
1
heard
2
a
1
solemn
2
Voice
1
that
1
seemed
1
to
1
come
1
from
1
somewhere
3
near
2
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
great
2
dome
1
and
1
it
1
said
1
I
1
am
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
Why
1
do
1
you
1
seek
1
me
1
They
1
looked
1
again
2
in
1
every
3
part
1
of
1
the
1
room
1
and
1
then
1
seeing
1
no
1
one
1
Dorothy
3
asked
1
Where
1
are
1
you
1
I
1
am
1
everywhere
4
answered
2
the
1
Voice
1
but
1
to
1
the
1
eyes
0
of
1
common
2
mortals
2
I
1
am
1
invisible
3
I
1
will
1
now
1
seat
2
myself
2
upon
2
my
1
throne
1
that
1
you
1
may
1
converse
2
with
1
me
1
Indeed
1
the
1
Voice
1
seemed
1
just
1
then
1
to
1
come
1
straight
1
from
1
the
1
throne
1
itself
2
so
1
they
1
walked
1
toward
2
it
1
and
1
stood
1
in
1
a
1
row
1
while
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
We
1
have
1
come
1
to
1
claim
1
our
1
promise
2
O
1
Oz
1
What
1
promise
2
asked
1
Oz
1
You
1
promised
2
to
1
send
1
me
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
when
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
was
1
destroyed
1
said
1
the
1
girl
1
And
1
you
1
promised
2
to
1
give
1
me
1
brains
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
And
1
you
1
promised
2
to
1
give
1
me
1
a
1
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
And
1
you
1
promised
2
to
1
give
1
me
1
courage
2
said
1
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
Is
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
really
3
destroyed
1
asked
1
the
1
Voice
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
thought
1
it
1
trembled
1
a
1
little
1
Yes
0
she
0
answered
2
I
1
melted
1
her
1
with
1
a
1
bucket
2
of
1
water
2
Dear
2
me
1
said
1
the
1
Voice
1
how
1
sudden
2
Well
1
come
1
to
1
me
1
tomorrow
3
for
1
I
1
must
1
have
1
time
1
to
1
think
1
it
1
over
2
You
1
've
0
had
1
plenty
2
of
1
time
1
already
4
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
angrily
3
We
1
sha
1
n't
0
wait
1
a
1
day
1
longer
2
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
You
1
must
1
keep
1
your
1
promises
2
to
1
us
1
exclaimed
2
Dorothy
3
The
1
Lion
1
thought
1
it
1
might
1
be
1
as
1
well
1
to
1
frighten
2
the
1
Wizard
2
so
1
he
1
gave
1
a
1
large
1
loud
1
roar
1
which
1
was
1
so
1
fierce
2
and
1
dreadful
3
that
1
Toto
2
jumped
1
away
2
from
1
him
1
in
1
alarm
2
and
1
tipped
1
over
2
the
1
screen
1
that
1
stood
1
in
1
a
1
corner
2
As
1
it
1
fell
1
with
1
a
1
crash
1
they
1
looked
1
that
1
way
1
and
1
the
1
next
1
moment
2
all
1
of
1
them
1
were
1
filled
1
with
1
wonder
2
For
1
they
1
saw
1
standing
2
in
1
just
1
the
1
spot
1
the
1
screen
1
had
1
hidden
2
a
1
little
1
old
1
man
1
with
1
a
1
bald
1
head
2
and
1
a
1
wrinkled
1
face
1
who
1
seemed
1
to
1
be
1
as
1
much
1
surprised
2
as
1
they
1
were
1
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
raising
2
his
1
axe
1
rushed
1
toward
2
the
1
little
1
man
1
and
1
cried
1
out
1
Who
1
are
1
you
1
I
1
am
1
Oz
1
the
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
said
1
the
1
little
1
man
1
in
1
a
1
trembling
2
voice
1
But
1
do
1
n't
0
strike
1
me
1
please
2
do
1
n't
0
and
1
I
1
'll
0
do
1
anything
3
you
1
want
1
me
1
to
1
Our
1
friends
2
looked
1
at
1
him
1
in
1
surprise
2
and
1
dismay
2
I
1
thought
1
Oz
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
Head
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
And
1
I
1
thought
1
Oz
1
was
1
a
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
And
1
I
1
thought
1
Oz
1
was
1
a
1
terrible
2
Beast
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
And
1
I
1
thought
1
Oz
1
was
1
a
1
Ball
1
of
1
Fire
1
exclaimed
2
the
1
Lion
1
No
1
you
1
are
1
all
1
wrong
1
said
1
the
1
little
1
man
1
meekly
2
I
1
have
1
been
1
making
2
believe
3
Making
2
believe
3
cried
1
Dorothy
3
Are
1
you
1
not
1
a
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
Hush
1
my
1
dear
2
he
1
said
1
Do
1
n't
0
speak
2
so
1
loud
1
or
1
you
1
will
1
be
1
overheard
4
and
1
I
1
should
1
be
1
ruined
1
I
1
'm
0
supposed
2
to
1
be
1
a
1
Great
2
Wizard
2
And
1
are
1
n't
0
you
1
she
0
asked
1
Not
1
a
1
bit
1
of
1
it
1
my
1
dear
2
I
1
'm
0
just
1
a
1
common
2
man
1
You
1
're
0
more
1
than
1
that
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
in
1
a
1
grieved
2
tone
1
you're
1
a
1
humbug
2
Exactly
3
so
1
declared
2
the
1
little
1
man
1
rubbing
2
his
1
hands
1
together
3
as
1
if
1
it
1
pleased
2
him
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
humbug
2
But
1
this
1
is
1
terrible
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
How
1
shall
1
I
1
ever
2
get
1
my
1
heart
2
Or
1
I
1
my
1
courage
2
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
Or
1
I
1
my
1
brains
1
wailed
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
wiping
2
the
1
tears
2
from
1
his
1
eyes
0
with
1
his
1
coat
1
sleeve
1
My
1
dear
2
friends
2
said
1
Oz
1
I
1
pray
1
you
1
not
1
to
1
speak
2
of
1
these
1
little
1
things
1
Think
1
of
1
me
1
and
1
the
1
terrible
2
trouble
1
I
1
'm
0
in
1
at
1
being
1
found
1
out
1
Does
0
n't
0
anyone
2
else
1
know
1
you
1
're
0
a
1
humbug
2
asked
1
Dorothy
3
No
1
one
1
knows
1
it
1
but
1
you
1
four
1
and
1
myself
2
replied
2
Oz
1
I
1
have
1
fooled
1
everyone
3
so
1
long
1
that
1
I
1
thought
1
I
1
should
1
never
2
be
1
found
1
out
1
It
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
mistake
2
my
1
ever
2
letting
2
you
1
into
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
Usually
3
I
1
will
1
not
1
see
1
even
2
my
1
subjects
2
and
1
so
1
they
1
believe
3
I
1
am
1
something
3
terrible
2
But
1
I
1
do
1
n't
0
understand
3
said
1
Dorothy
3
in
1
bewilderment
4
How
1
was
1
it
1
that
1
you
1
appeared
3
to
1
me
1
as
1
a
1
great
2
Head
2
That
1
was
1
one
1
of
1
my
1
tricks
1
answered
2
Oz
1
Step
1
this
1
way
1
please
2
and
1
I
1
will
1
tell
1
you
1
all
1
about
2
it
1
He
1
led
0
the
1
way
1
to
1
a
1
small
1
chamber
2
in
1
the
1
rear
2
of
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
they
1
all
1
followed
2
him
1
He
1
pointed
1
to
1
one
1
corner
2
in
1
which
1
lay
1
the
1
great
2
Head
2
made
1
out
1
of
1
many
2
thicknesses
2
of
1
paper
2
and
1
with
1
a
1
carefully
4
painted
1
face
1
This
1
I
1
hung
1
from
1
the
1
ceiling
2
by
1
a
1
wire
1
said
1
Oz
1
I
1
stood
1
behind
2
the
1
screen
1
and
1
pulled
1
a
1
thread
2
to
1
make
1
the
1
eyes
0
move
1
and
1
the
1
mouth
1
open
2
But
1
how
1
about
2
the
1
voice
1
she
0
inquired
2
Oh
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
ventriloquist
4
said
1
the
1
little
1
man
1
I
1
can
1
throw
1
the
1
sound
1
of
1
my
1
voice
1
wherever
3
I
1
wish
1
so
1
that
1
you
1
thought
1
it
1
was
1
coming
2
out
1
of
1
the
1
Head
2
Here
1
are
1
the
1
other
2
things
1
I
1
used
1
to
1
deceive
2
you
1
He
1
showed
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
the
1
dress
1
and
1
the
1
mask
1
he
1
had
1
worn
1
when
1
he
1
seemed
1
to
1
be
1
the
1
lovely
3
Lady
2
And
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
saw
1
that
1
his
1
terrible
2
Beast
2
was
1
nothing
2
but
1
a
1
lot
1
of
1
skins
1
sewn
1
together
3
with
1
slats
1
to
1
keep
1
their
1
sides
1
out
1
As
1
for
1
the
1
Ball
1
of
1
Fire
1
the
1
false
1
Wizard
2
had
1
hung
1
that
1
also
2
from
1
the
1
ceiling
2
It
1
was
1
really
3
a
1
ball
1
of
1
cotton
2
but
1
when
1
oil
1
was
1
poured
1
upon
2
it
1
the
1
ball
1
burned
1
fiercely
4
Really
3
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
you
1
ought
1
to
1
be
1
ashamed
2
of
1
yourself
2
for
1
being
1
such
1
a
1
humbug
2
I
1
am
1
I
1
certainly
3
am
1
answered
2
the
1
little
1
man
1
sorrowfully
4
but
1
it
1
was
1
the
1
only
2
thing
1
I
1
could
1
do
1
Sit
1
down
1
please
2
there
1
are
1
plenty
2
of
1
chairs
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
tell
1
you
1
my
1
story
2
So
1
they
1
sat
1
down
1
and
1
listened
2
while
1
he
1
told
1
the
1
following
3
tale
1
I
1
was
1
born
1
in
1
Omaha
3
Why
1
that
1
is
1
n't
0
very
2
far
1
from
1
Kansas
2
cried
1
Dorothy
3
No
1
but
1
it
1
's
0
farther
2
from
1
here
1
he
1
said
1
shaking
2
his
1
head
2
at
1
her
1
sadly
2
When
1
I
1
grew
1
up
1
I
1
became
2
a
1
ventriloquist
4
and
1
at
1
that
1
I
1
was
1
very
2
well
1
trained
1
by
1
a
1
great
2
master
2
I
1
can
1
imitate
3
any
2
kind
1
of
1
a
1
bird
1
or
1
beast
2
Here
1
he
1
mewed
1
so
1
like
1
a
1
kitten
2
that
1
Toto
2
pricked
1
up
1
his
1
ears
2
and
1
looked
1
everywhere
4
to
1
see
1
where
1
she
0
was
1
After
2
a
1
time
1
continued
2
Oz
1
I
1
tired
1
of
1
that
1
and
1
became
2
a
1
balloonist
3
What
1
is
1
that
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
A
1
man
1
who
1
goes
0
up
1
in
1
a
1
balloon
2
on
1
circus
2
day
1
so
1
as
1
to
1
draw
1
a
1
crowd
1
of
1
people
1
together
3
and
1
get
1
them
1
to
1
pay
1
to
1
see
1
the
1
circus
2
he
1
explained
2
Oh
1
she
0
said
1
I
1
know
1
Well
1
one
1
day
1
I
1
went
1
up
1
in
1
a
1
balloon
2
and
1
the
1
ropes
1
got
1
twisted
1
so
1
that
1
I
1
could
1
n't
0
come
1
down
1
again
2
It
1
went
1
way
1
up
1
above
2
the
1
clouds
1
so
1
far
1
that
1
a
1
current
2
of
1
air
1
struck
1
it
1
and
1
carried
2
it
1
many
2
many
2
miles
1
away
2
For
1
a
1
day
1
and
1
a
1
night
1
I
1
traveled
2
through
1
the
1
air
1
and
1
on
1
the
1
morning
2
of
1
the
1
second
2
day
1
I
1
awoke
2
and
1
found
1
the
1
balloon
2
floating
2
over
2
a
1
strange
1
and
1
beautiful
4
country
2
It
1
came
1
down
1
gradually
3
and
1
I
1
was
1
not
1
hurt
1
a
1
bit
1
But
1
I
1
found
1
myself
2
in
1
the
1
midst
1
of
1
a
1
strange
1
people
1
who
1
seeing
1
me
1
come
1
from
1
the
1
clouds
1
thought
1
I
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
Wizard
2
Of
1
course
1
I
1
let
1
them
1
think
1
so
1
because
2
they
1
were
1
afraid
2
of
1
me
1
and
1
promised
2
to
1
do
1
anything
3
I
1
wished
1
them
1
to
1
Just
1
to
1
amuse
2
myself
2
and
1
keep
1
the
1
good
1
people
1
busy
2
I
1
ordered
2
them
1
to
1
build
1
this
1
City
2
and
1
my
1
Palace
2
and
1
they
1
did
1
it
1
all
1
willingly
3
and
1
well
1
Then
1
I
1
thought
1
as
1
the
1
country
2
was
1
so
1
green
1
and
1
beautiful
4
I
1
would
1
call
1
it
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
to
1
make
1
the
1
name
1
fit
1
better
2
I
1
put
1
green
1
spectacles
2
on
1
all
1
the
1
people
1
so
1
that
1
everything
4
they
1
saw
1
was
1
green
1
But
1
is
1
n't
0
everything
4
here
1
green
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
No
1
more
1
than
1
in
1
any
2
other
2
city
2
replied
2
Oz
1
but
1
when
1
you
1
wear
2
green
1
spectacles
2
why
1
of
1
course
1
everything
4
you
1
see
1
looks
1
green
1
to
1
you
1
The
1
Emerald
3
City
2
was
1
built
1
a
1
great
2
many
2
years
2
ago
2
for
1
I
1
was
1
a
1
young
1
man
1
when
1
the
1
balloon
2
brought
1
me
1
here
1
and
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
very
2
old
1
man
1
now
1
But
1
my
1
people
1
have
1
worn
1
green
1
glasses
1
on
1
their
1
eyes
0
so
1
long
1
that
1
most
1
of
1
them
1
think
1
it
1
really
3
is
1
an
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
it
1
certainly
3
is
1
a
1
beautiful
4
place
1
abounding
3
in
1
jewels
2
and
1
precious
2
metals
2
and
1
every
3
good
1
thing
1
that
1
is
1
needed
1
to
1
make
1
one
1
happy
2
I
1
have
1
been
1
good
1
to
1
the
1
people
1
and
1
they
1
like
1
me
1
but
1
ever
2
since
1
this
1
Palace
2
was
1
built
1
I
1
have
1
shut
1
myself
2
up
1
and
1
would
1
not
1
see
1
any
2
of
1
them
1
One
1
of
1
my
1
greatest
3
fears
2
was
1
the
1
Witches
1
for
1
while
1
I
1
had
1
no
1
magical
3
powers
2
at
1
all
1
I
1
soon
1
found
1
out
1
that
1
the
1
Witches
1
were
1
really
3
able
1
to
1
do
1
wonderful
3
things
1
There
1
were
1
four
1
of
1
them
1
in
1
this
1
country
2
and
1
they
1
ruled
1
the
1
people
1
who
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
North
1
and
1
South
1
and
1
East
2
and
1
West
1
Fortunately
5
the
1
Witches
1
of
1
the
1
North
1
and
1
South
1
were
1
good
1
and
1
I
1
knew
1
they
1
would
1
do
1
me
1
no
1
harm
1
but
1
the
1
Witches
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
and
1
West
1
were
1
terribly
3
wicked
1
and
1
had
1
they
1
not
1
thought
1
I
1
was
1
more
1
powerful
3
than
1
they
1
themselves
2
they
1
would
1
surely
3
have
1
destroyed
1
me
1
As
1
it
1
was
1
I
1
lived
1
in
1
deadly
3
fear
2
of
1
them
1
for
1
many
2
years
2
so
1
you
1
can
1
imagine
3
how
1
pleased
2
I
1
was
1
when
1
I
1
heard
2
your
1
house
1
had
1
fallen
2
on
1
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
East
2
When
1
you
1
came
1
to
1
me
1
I
1
was
1
willing
2
to
1
promise
2
anything
3
if
1
you
1
would
1
only
2
do
1
away
2
with
1
the
1
other
2
Witch
1
but
1
now
1
that
1
you
1
have
1
melted
1
her
1
I
1
am
1
ashamed
2
to
1
say
1
that
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
keep
1
my
1
promises
2
I
1
think
1
you
1
are
1
a
1
very
2
bad
1
man
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
Oh
1
no
1

the

You

You

A

Experience

the

the

Scarecrow

but

I

shall

be

very

unhappy

you

The
1
false
1
Wizard
2
looked
1
at
1
him
1
carefully
4
Well
1
he
1
said
1
with
1
a
1
sigh
1
I
1
'm
0
not

of

me

tomorrow

morning
2
I
1
will
1
stuff
1
your
1
head
2
with
1
brains
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
tell
1
you
1
how
1
to
1
use
1
them
1
however
3
you
1
must
1
find
1
that

out
1
for

yourself
2
Oh
1
thank
1
you
1
thank

1
the

Scarecrow
3
I

'll

a

way

never

fear
2
But
1
how
1
about
2
my
1
courage
2
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
anxiously
3
You

have
1
plenty
2
of
1
courage
2
I
1
am
1
sure
1
answered
2
Oz
1
All
1
you
1
need
0
is
1
confidence
3
in
1
yourself
2
There
1
is
1
no
1
living
2
thing
1
that

is
1
not

when

it

faces

The

True
0
courage
2
is
1
in
1
facing
2
danger
2
when
1
you

are
1
afraid
2
and
1
that
1
kind
1
of
1
courage
2
you
1
have
1
in
1
plenty
2
Perhaps
2
I
1
have
1
but
1
I
1
'm
0
scared
1
just
1
the
1
same
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
shall
1
really
3
be
1
very
2
unhappy
3
unless
2
you
1
give
1
me
1
the
1
sort
1
of
1
courage
2
that
1
makes
1
one
1
forget
2
he
1
is
1
afraid
2
Very
2
well
1
I
1
will
1
give
1
you
1
that
1
sort
1
of
1
courage
2
tomorrow
3
replied
2
Oz
1
How
1
about
2
my
1
heart
2
asked
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
Why
1
as
1
for
1
that
1
answered
2
Oz
1
I
1
think
1
you
1
are
1
wrong
1
to
1
want
1
a
1
heart
2
It
1
makes
1
most
1
people
1
unhappy
3
If
1
you
1
only
2
knew
1
it
1
you
1
are
1
in
1
luck
1
not
1
to
1
have
1
a
1
heart
2
That
1
must
1
be
1
a
1
matter
2
of
1
opinion
3
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
For
1
my
1
part
1
I
1
will
1
bear
2
all
1
the
1
unhappiness
4
without
2
a
1
murmur
2
if
1
you
1
will
1
give
1
me
1
the
1
heart
2
Very
2
well
1
answered
2
Oz
1
meekly
2
Come
1
to
1
me
1
tomorrow
3
and
1
you
1
shall
1
have
1
a
1
heart
2
I
1
have
1
played
0
Wizard
2
for
1
so
1
many
2
years
2
that
1
I
1
may
1
as
1
well
1
continue
2
the
1
part
1
a
1
little
1
longer
2
And
1
now
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
how
1
am
1
I
1
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
We
1
shall
1
have
1
to
1
think
1
about
2
that
1
replied
2
the
1
little
1
man
1
Give
1
me
1
two
1
or
1
three
1
days
1
to
1
consider
3
the
1
matter
2
and
1
I
1
'll
0
try
1
to
1
find
1
a
1
way
1
to
1
carry
2
you
1
over
2
the
1
desert
2
In
1
the
1
meantime
3
you
1
shall
1
all
1
be
1
treated
2
as
1
my
1
guests
1
and
1
while
1
you
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
Palace
2
my
1
people
1
will
1
wait
1
upon
2
you
1
and
1
obey
2
your
1
slightest
2
wish
1
There
1
is
1
only
2
one
1
thing
1
I
1
ask
1
in
1
return
2
for
1
my
1
help
1
such
1
as
1
it
1
is
1
You
1
must
1
keep
1
my
1
secret
2
and
1
tell
1
no
1
one
1
I
1
am
1
a
1
humbug
2
They
1
agreed
1
to
1
say
1
nothing
2
of
1
what
1
they
1
had
1
learned
2
and
1
went
1
back
1
to
1
their
1
rooms
1
in
1
high
1
spirits
2
Even
2
Dorothy
3
had
1
hope
1
that
1
The
1
Great
2
and
1
Terrible
2
Humbug
2
as
1
she
0
called
1
him
1
would
1
find
1
a
1
way
1
to
1
send
1
her
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
if
1
he
1
did
1
she
0
was
1
willing
2
to
1
forgive
2
him
1
everything
4
Next
1
morning
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
said
1
to
1
his
1
friends
2
Congratulate
4
me
1
I
1
am
1
going
1
to
1
Oz
1
to
1
get
1
my
1
brains
1
at
1
last
1
When
1
I
1
return
2
I
1
shall
1
be
1
as
1
other
2
men
1
are
1
I
1
have
1
always
2
liked
1
you
1
as
1
you
1
were
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
simply
2
It
1
is
1
kind
1
of
1
you
1
to
1
like
1
a
1
Scarecrow
3
he
1
replied
2
But
1
surely
3
you
1
will
1
think
1
more
1
of
1
me
1
when
1
you
1
hear
2
the
1
splendid
2
thoughts
1
my
1
new
1
brain
1
is
1
going
1
to
1
turn
1
out
1
Then
1
he
1
said
1
good-bye
1
to
1
them
1
all
1
in
1
a
1
cheerful
2
voice
1
and
1
went
1
to
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
where
1
he
1
rapped
1
upon
2
the
1
door
1
Come
1
in
1
said
1
Oz
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
went
1
in
1
and
1
found
1
the
1
little
1
man
1
sitting
2
down
1
by
1
the
1
window
2
engaged
2
in
1
deep
1
thought
1
I
1
have
1
come
1
for
1
my
1
brains
1
remarked
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
a
1
little
1
uneasily
5
Oh
1
yes
0
sit
1
down
1
in
1
that
1
chair
1
please
2
replied
2
Oz
1
You
1
must
1
excuse
2
me
1
for
1
taking
2
your
1
head
2
off
1
but
1
I
1
shall
1
have
1
to
1
do
1
it
1
in
1
order
2
to
1
put
1
your
1
brains
1
in
1
their
1
proper
2
place
1
That
1
's
0
all
1
right
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
You
1
are
1
quite
1
welcome
2
to
1
take
1
my
1
head
2
off
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
it
1
will
1
be
1
a
1
better
2
one
1
when
1
you
1
put
1
it
1
on
1
again
2
So
1
the
1
Wizard
2
unfastened
3
his
1
head
2
and
1
emptied
2
out
1
the
1
straw
1
Then
1
he
1
entered
2
the
1
back
1
room
1
and
1
took
1
up
1
a
1
measure
3
of
1
bran
1
which
1
he
1
mixed
1
with
1
a
1
great
2
many
2
pins
1
and
1
needles
1
Having
2
shaken
2
them
1
together
3
thoroughly
3
he
1
filled
1
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
's
0
head
2
with
1
the
1
mixture
2
and
1
stuffed
1
the
1
rest
1
of
1
the
1
space
1
with
1
straw
1
to
1
hold
1
it
1
in
1
place
1
When
1
he
1
had
1
fastened
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
's
0
head
2
on
1
his
1
body
2
again
2
he
1
said
1
to
1
him
1
Hereafter
4
you
1
will
1
be
1
a
1
great
2
man
1
for
1
I
1
have
1
given
2
you
1
a
1
lot
1
of
1
bran-new
2
brains
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
was
1
both
1
pleased
2
and
1
proud
1
at
1
the
1
fulfillment
3
of
1
his
1
greatest
3
wish
1
and
1
having
2
thanked
1
Oz
1
warmly
2
he
1
went
1
back
1
to
1
his
1
friends
2
Dorothy
3
looked
1
at
1
him
1
curiously
3
His
1
head
2
was
1
quite
1
bulged
1
out
1
at
1
the
1
top
1
with
1
brains
1
How
1
do
1
you
1
feel
1
she
0
asked
1
I
1
feel
1
wise
1
indeed
1
he
1
answered
2
earnestly
4
When
1
I
1
get
1
used
1
to
1
my
1
brains
1
I
1
shall
1
know
1
everything
4
Why
1
are
1
those
1
needles
1
and
1
pins
1
sticking
2
out
1
of
1
your
1
head
2
asked
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
That
1
is
1
proof
1
that
1
he
1
is
1
sharp
1
remarked
2
the
1
Lion
1
Well
1
I
1
must
1
go
1
to
1
Oz
1
and
1
get
1
my
1
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
So
1
he
1
walked
1
to
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
knocked
1
at
1
the
1
door
1
Come
1
in
1
called
1
Oz
1
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
entered
2
and
1
said
1
I
1
have
1
come
1
for
1
my
1
heart
2
Very
2
well
1
answered
2
the
1
little
1
man
1
But
1
I
1
shall
1
have
1
to
1
cut
1
a
1
hole
1
in
1
your
1
breast
2
so
1
I
1
can
1
put
1
your
1
heart
2
in
1
the
1
right
1
place
1
I
1
hope
1
it
1
wo
1
n't
0
hurt
1
you
1
Oh
1
no
1
answered
2
the
1
Woodman
2
I
1
shall
1
not
1
feel
1
it
1
at
1
all
1
So
1
Oz
1
brought
1
a
1
pair
1
of
1
tinsmith
2
's
0
shears
2
and
1
cut
1
a
1
small
1
square
1
hole
1
in
1
the
1
left
1
side
1
of
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
's
0
breast
2
Then
1
going
1
to
1
a
1
chest
1
of
1
drawers
2
he
1
took
1
out
1
a
1
pretty
2
heart
2
made
1
entirely
4
of
1
silk
1
and
1
stuffed
1
with
1
sawdust
2
Is
1
n't
0
it
1
a
1
beauty
3
he
1
asked
1
It
1
is
1
indeed
1
replied
2
the
1
Woodman
2
who
1
was
1
greatly
3
pleased
2
But
1
is
1
it
1
a
1
kind
1
heart
2
Oh
1
very
2
answered
2
Oz
1
He
1
put
1
the
1
heart
2
in
1
the
1
Woodman
2
's
0
breast
2
and
1
then
1
replaced
2
the
1
square
1
of
1
tin
1
soldering
3
it
1
neatly
3
together
3
where
1
it
1
had
1
been
1
cut
1
There
1
said
1
he
1
now
1
you
1
have
1
a
1
heart
2
that
1
any
2
man
1
might
1
be
1
proud
1
of
1
I
1
'm
0
sorry
2
I
1
had
1
to
1
put
1
a
1
patch
1
on
1
your
1
breast
2
but
1
it
1
really
3
couldn't
1
be
1
helped
1
Never
2
mind
1
the
1
patch
1
exclaimed
2
the
1
happy
2
Woodman
2
I
1
am
1
very
2
grateful
3
to
1
you
1
and
1
shall
1
never
2
forget
2
your
1
kindness
2
Do
1
n't
0
speak
2
of
1
it
1
replied
2
Oz
1
Then
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
went
1
back
1
to
1
his
1
friends
2
who
1
wished
1
him
1
every
3
joy
1
on
1
account
2
of
1
his
1
good
1
fortune
2
The
1
Lion
1
now
1
walked
1
to
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
knocked
1
at
1
the
1
door
1
Come
1
in
1
said
1
Oz
1
I
1
have
1
come
1
for
1
my
1
courage
2
announced
2
the
1
Lion
1
entering
3
the
1
room
1
Very
2
well
1
answered
2
the
1
little
1
man
1
I
1
will
1
get
1
it
1
for
1
you
1
He
1
went
1
to
1
a
1
cupboard
2
and
1
reaching
3
up
1
to
1
a
1
high
1
shelf
1
took
1
down
1
a
1
square
1
green
1
bottle
1
the
1
contents
2
of
1
which
1
he
1
poured
1
into
2
a
1
green-gold
2
dish
1
beautifully
5
carved
1
Placing
2
this
1
before
2
the
1
Cowardly
3
Lion
1
who
1
sniffed
1
at
1
it
1
as
1
if
1
he
1
did
1
not
1
like
1
it
1
the
1
Wizard
2
said
1
Drink
1
What
1
is
1
it
1
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
Well
1
answered
2
Oz
1
if
1
it
1
were
1
inside
2
of
1
you
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
courage
2
You
1
know
1
of
1
course
1
that
1
courage
2
is
1
always
2
inside
2
one
1
so
1
that
1
this
1
really
3
can
1
not
1
be
1
called
1
courage
2
until
2
you
1
have
1
swallowed
2
it
1
Therefore
3
I
1
advise
2
you
1
to
1
drink
1
it
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
possible
2
The
1
Lion
1
hesitated
3
no
1
longer
2
but
1
drank
1
till
1
the
1
dish
1
was
1
empty
2
How
1
do
1
you
1
feel
1
now
1
asked
1
Oz
1
Full
1
of
1
courage
2
replied
2
the
1
Lion
1
who
1
went
1
joyfully
3
back
1
to
1
his
1
friends
2
to
1
tell
1
them
1
of
1
his
1
good
1
fortune
2
Oz
1
left
1
to
1
himself
2
smiled
1
to
1
think
1
of
1
his
1
success
2
in
1
giving
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
exactly
3
what
1
they
1
thought
1
they
1
wanted
1
How
1
can
1
I
1
help
1
being
1
a
1
humbug
2
he
1
said
1
when
1
all
1
these
1
people
1
make
1
me
1
do
1
things
1
that
1
everybody
5
knows
1
ca
1
n't
0
be
1
done
1
It
1
was
1
easy
3
to
1
make
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
happy
2
because
2
they
1
imagined
3
I
1
could
1
do
1
anything
3
But
1
it
1
will
1
take
1
more
1
than
1
imagination
5
to
1
carry
2
Dorothy
3
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
I
1
'm
0
sure
1
I
1
do
1
n't
0
know
1
how
1
it
1
can
1
be
1
done
1
For
1
three
1
days
1
Dorothy
3
heard
2
nothing
2
from
1
Oz
1
These
1
were
1
sad
1
days
1
for
1
the
1
little
1
girl
1
although
2
her
1
friends
2
were
1
all
1
quite
1
happy
2
and
1
contented
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
told
1
them
1
there
1
were
1
wonderful
3
thoughts
1
in
1
his
1
head
2
but
1
he
1
would
1
not
1
say
1
what
1
they
1
were
1
because
2
he
1
knew
1
no
1
one
1
could
1
understand
3
them
1
but
1
himself
2
When
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
walked
1
about
2
he
1
felt
1
his
1
heart
2
rattling
2
around
2
in
1
his
1
breast
2
and
1
he
1
told
1
Dorothy
3
he
1
had
1
discovered
3
it
1
to
1
be
1
a
1
kinder
2
and
1
more
1
tender
2
heart
2
than
1
the
1
one
1
he
1
had
1
owned
1
when
1
he
1
was
1
made
1
of
1
flesh
1
The
1
Lion
1
declared
2
he
1
was
1
afraid
2
of
1
nothing
2
on
1
earth
2
and
1
would
1
gladly
2
face
1
an
1
army
2
or
1
a
1
dozen
2
of
1
the
1
fierce
2
Kalidahs
3
Thus
1
each
2
of
1
the
1
little
1
party
2
was
1
satisfied
3
except
2
Dorothy
3
who
1
longed
1
more
1
than
1
ever
2
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
On
1
the
1
fourth
1
day
1
to
1
her
1
great
2
joy
1
Oz
1
sent
1
for
1
her
1
and
1
when
1
she
0
entered
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
he
1
greeted
1
her
1
pleasantly
4
Sit
1
down
1
my
1
dear
2
I
1
think
1
I
1
have
1
found
1
the
1
way
1
to
1
get
1
you
1
out
1
of
1
this
1
country
2
And
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
she
0
asked
1
eagerly
4
Well
1
I
1
'm
0
not
1
sure
1
about
2
Kansas
2
said
1
Oz
1
for
1
I
1
have
1
n't
0
the
1
faintest
2
notion
2
which
1
way
1
it
1
lies
1
But
1
the
1
first
1
thing
1
to
1
do
1
is
1
to
1
cross
1
the
1
desert
2
and
1
then
1
it
1
should
1
be
1
easy
3
to
1
find
1
your
1
way
1
home
1
How
1
can
1
I
1
cross
1
the
1
desert
2
she
0
inquired
2
Well
1
I
1
'll
0
tell
1
you
1
what
1
I
1
think
1
said
1
the
1
little
1
man
1
You
1
see
1
when
1
I
1
came
1
to
1
this
1
country
2
it
1
was
1
in
1
a
1
balloon
2
You
1
also
2
came
1
through
1
the
1
air
1
being
1
carried
2
by
1
a
1
cyclone
2
So
1
I
1
believe
3
the
1
best
1
way
1
to
1
get
1
across
2
the
1
desert
2
will
1
be
1
through
1
the
1
air
1
Now
1
it
1
is
1
quite
1
beyond
1
my
1
powers
2
to
1
make
1
a
1
cyclone
2
but
1
I
1
've
0
been
1
thinking
2
the
1
matter
2
over
2
and
1
I
1
believe
3
I
1
can
1
make
1
a
1
balloon
2
How
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
A
1
balloon
2
said
1
Oz
1
is
1
made
1
of
1
silk
1
which
1
is
1
coated
1
with
1
glue
0
to
1
keep
1
the
1
gas
1
in
1
it

I
1
have
1
plenty
2
of
1
silk
1
in
1
the
1
Palace
2
so
1
it
1
will
1
be
1
no
1
trouble
1
to
1
make
1
the
1
balloon
2
But
1
in
1
all
1
this
1
country
2
there
1
is
1
no
1
gas
1
to
1
fill
1
the
1
balloon
2
with
1
to
1
make
1
it
1
float
1
If
1
it
1
wo
1
n't
0
float
1
remarked
2
Dorothy
3
it
1
will
1
be
1
of
1
no
1
use
1
to
1
us
1
True
0
answered
2
Oz
1
But
1
there
1
is
1
another
3
way
1
to
1
make
1
it
1
float
1
which
1
is
1
to
1
fill
1
it
1
with
1
hot
1
air
1
Hot
1
air
1
is
1
n't
0
as
1
good
1
as
1
gas
1
for
1
if
1
the
1
air
1
should
1
get
1
cold
1
the
1
balloon
2
would
1
come
1
down
1
in
1
the
1
desert
2
and
1
we
1
should
1
be
1
lost
1
We
1
exclaimed
2
the
1
girl
1
Are
1
you
1
going
1
with
1
me
1
Yes
0
of
1
course
1
replied
2
Oz
1
I
1
am
1
tired
1
of
1
being
1
such
1
a
1
humbug
2
If
1
I
1
should
1
go
1
out
1
of
1
this
1
Palace
2
my
1
people
1
would
1
soon
1
discover
3
I
1
am
1
not
1
a
1
Wizard
2
and
1
then
1
they
1
would
1
be
1
vexed
1
with
1
me
1
for
1
having
2
deceived
2
them
1
So
1
I
1
have
1
to
1
stay
1
shut
1
up
1
in
1
these
1
rooms
1
all
1
day
1
and
1
it
1
gets
1
tiresome
3
I
1
'd
0
much
1
rather
2
go
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
with
1
you
1
and
1
be
1
in
1
a
1
circus
2
again
2
I
1
shall
1
be
1
glad
1
to
1
have
1
your
1
company
3
said
1
Dorothy
3
Thank
1
you
1
he
1
answered
2
Now
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
help
1
me
1
sew
1
the
1
silk
1
together
3
we
1
will
1
begin
2
to
1
work
1
on
1
our
1
balloon
2
So
1
Dorothy
3
took
1
a
1
needle
1
and
1
thread
2
and
1
as
1
fast
1
as
1
Oz
1
cut
1
the
1
strips
1
of
1
silk
1
into
2
proper
2
shape
1
the
1
girl
1
sewed
1
them
1
neatly
3
together
3
First
1
there
1
was
1
a
1
strip
1
of
1
light
1
green
1
silk
1
then
1
a
1
strip
1
of
1
dark
1
green
1
and
1
then
1
a
1
strip
1
of
1
emerald
3
green
1
for
1
Oz
1
had
1
a
1
fancy
2
to
1
make
1
the
1
balloon
2
in
1
different
3
shades
1
of
1
the
1
color
2
about
2
them
1
It
1
took
1
three
1
days
1
to
1
sew
1
all
1
the
1
strips
1
together
3
but
1
when
1
it
1
was
1
finished
2
they
1
had
1
a
1
big
1
bag
1
of
1
green
1
silk
1
more
1
than
1
twenty
2
feet
1
long
1
Then
1
Oz
1
painted
1
it
1
on
1
the
1
inside
2
with
1
a
1
coat
1
of
1
thin
1
glue
0
to
1
make
1
it
1
airtight
2
after
2
which
1
he
1
announced
2
that
1
the
1
balloon
2
was
1
ready
3
But
1
we
1
must
1
have
1
a
1
basket
2
to
1
ride
1
in
1
he
1
said
1
So
1
he
1
sent
1
the
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
for
1
a
1
big
1
clothes
1
basket
2
which
1
he
1
fastened
2
with
1
many
2
ropes
1
to
1
the
1
bottom
2
of
1
the
1
balloon
2
When
1
it
1
was
1
all
1
ready
3
Oz
1
sent
1
word
1
to
1
his
1
people
1
that
1
he
1
was
1
going
1
to
1
make
1
a
1
visit
2
to
1
a
1
great
2
brother
2
Wizard
2
who
1
lived
1
in
1
the
1
clouds
1
The
1
news
1
spread
2
rapidly
3
throughout
2
the
1
city
2
and
1
everyone
3
came
1
to
1
see
1
the
1
wonderful
3
sight
1
Oz
1
ordered
2
the
1
balloon
2
carried
2
out
1
in
1
front
1
of
1
the
1
Palace
2
and
1
the
1
people
1
gazed
1
upon
2
it
1
with
1
much
1
curiosity
4
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
had
1
chopped
1
a
1
big
1
pile
1
of
1
wood
1
and
1
now
1
he
1
made
1
a
1
fire
1
of
1
it
1
and
1
Oz
1
held
1
the
1
bottom
2
of
1
the
1
balloon
2
over
2
the
1
fire
1
so
1
that
1
the
1
hot
1
air
1
that
1
arose
2
from
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
caught
1
in
1
the
1
silken
2
bag
1
Gradually
3
the
1
balloon
2
swelled
1
out
1
and
1
rose
1
into
2
the
1
air
1
until
2
finally
3
the
1
basket
2
just
1
touched
1
the
1
ground
1
Then
1
Oz
1
got
1
into
2
the
1
basket
2
and
1
said
1
to
1
all
1
the
1
people
1
in
1
a
1
loud
1
voice
1
I
1
am
1
now
1
going
1
away
2
to
1
make
1
a
1
visit
2
While
1
I
1
am
1
gone
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
will
1
rule
1
over
2
you
1
I
1
command
2
you
1
to
1
obey
2
him
1
as
1
you
1
would
1
me
1
The
1
balloon
2
was
1
by
1
this
1
time
1
tugging
2
hard
1
at
1
the
1
rope
1
that
1
held
1
it
1
to
1
the
1
ground
1
for
1
the
1
air
1
within
2
it
1
was
1
hot
1
and
1
this
1
made
1
it
1
so
1
much
1
lighter
2
in
1
weight
1
than
1
the
1
air
1
without
2
that
1
it
1
pulled
1
hard
1
to
1
rise
1
into
2
the
1
sky
1
Come
1
Dorothy
3
cried
1
the
1
Wizard
2
Hurry
2
up
1
or
1
the
1
balloon
2
will
1
fly
1
away
2
I
1
ca
1
n't
0
find
1
Toto
2
anywhere
3
replied
2
Dorothy
3
who
1
did
1
not
1
wish
1
to
1
leave
2
her
1
little
1
dog
1
behind
2
Toto
2
had
1
run
1
into
2
the
1
crowd
1
to
1
bark
1
at
1
a
1
kitten
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
at
1
last
1
found
1
him
1
She
0
picked
1
him
1
up
1
and
1
ran
1
towards
2
the
1
balloon
2
She
0
was
1
within
2
a
1
few
1
steps
1
of
1
it
1
and
1
Oz
1
was
1
holding
2
out
1
his
1
hands
1
to
1
help
1
her
1
into
2
the
1
basket
2
when
1
crack
1
went
1
the
1
ropes
1
and
1
the
1
balloon
2
rose
1
into
2
the
1
air
1
without
2
her
1
Come
1
back
1
she
0
screamed
2
I
1
want
1
to
1
go
1
too
1
I
1
ca
1
n't
0
come
1
back
1
my
1
dear
2
called
1
Oz
1
from
1
the
1
basket
2
Good-bye
1
Good-bye
1
shouted
1
everyone
3
and
1
all
1
eyes
0
were
1
turned
1
upward
2
to
1
where
1
the
1
Wizard
2
was
1
riding
2
in
1
the
1
basket
2
rising
2
every
3
moment
2
farther
2
and
1
farther
2
into
2
the
1
sky
1
And
1
that
1
was
1
the
1
last
1
any
2
of
1
them
1
ever
2
saw
1
of
1
Oz
1
the
1
Wonderful
3
Wizard
2
though
1
he
1
may
1
have
1
reached
2
Omaha
3
safely
3
and
1
be
1
there
1
now
1
for
1
all
1
we
1
know
1
But
1
the
1
people
1
remembered
3
him
1
lovingly
3
and
1
said
1
to
1
one
1
another
3
Oz
1
was
1
always
2
our
1
friend
2
When
1
he
1
was
1
here
1
he
1
built
1
for
1
us
1
this
1
beautiful
4
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
now
1
he
1
is
1
gone
1
he
1
has
1
left
1
the
1
Wise
1
Scarecrow
3
to
1
rule
1
over
2
us
1
Still
1
for
1
many
2
days
1
they
1
grieved
2
over
2
the
1
loss
1
of
1
the
1
Wonderful
3
Wizard
2
and
1
would
1
not
1
be
1
comforted
2
Dorothy
3
wept
1
bitterly
3
at
1
the
1
passing
2
of
1
her
1
hope
1
to
1
get
1
home
1
to
1
Kansas
2
again
2
but
1
when
1
she
0
thought
1
it
1
all
1
over
2
she
0
was
1
glad
1
she
0
had
1
not
1
gone
1
up
1
in
1
a
1
balloon
2
And
1
she
0
also
2
felt
1
sorry
2
at
1
losing
2
Oz
1
and
1
so
1
did
1
her
1
companions
3
The
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
came
1
to
1
her
1
and
1
said
1
Truly
2
I
1
should
1
be
1
ungrateful
4
if
1
I
1
failed
1
to
1
mourn
1
for
1
the
1
man
1
who
1
gave
1
me
1
my
1
lovely
3
heart
2
I
1
should
1
like
1
to
1
cry
1
a
1
little
1
because
2
Oz
1
is
1
gone
1
if
1
you
1
will
1
kindly
2
wipe
1
away
2
my
1
tears
2
so
1
that
1
I
1
shall
1
not
1
rust
1
With
1
pleasure
3
she
0
answered
2
and
1
brought
1
a
1
towel
2
at
1
once
1
Then
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
wept
1
for
1
several
3
minutes
2
and
1
she
0
watched
1
the
1
tears
2
carefully
4
and
1
wiped
1
them
1
away
2
with
1
the
1
towel
2
When
1
he
1
had
1
finished
2
he
1
thanked
1
her
1
kindly
2
and
1
oiled
1
himself
2
thoroughly
3
with
1
his
1
jeweled
2
oil-can
2
to
1
guard
1
against
2
mishap
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
was
1
now
1
the
1
ruler
2
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
and
1
although
2
he
1
was
1
not
1
a
1
Wizard
2
the
1
people
1
were
1
proud
1
of
1
him
1
For
1
they
1
said
1
there
1
is
1
not
1
another
3
city
2
in
1
all
1
the
1
world
1
that
1
is
1
ruled
1
by
1
a
1
stuffed
1
man
1
And
1
so
1
far
1
as
1
they
1
knew
1
they
1
were
1
quite
1
right
1
The
1
morning
2
after
2
the
1
balloon
2
had
1
gone
1
up
1
with
1
Oz
1
the
1
four
1
travelers
3
met
1
in
1
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
and
1
talked
1
matters
2
over
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
sat
1
in
1
the
1
big
1
throne
1
and
1
the
1
others
2
stood
1
respectfully
4
before
2
him
1
We
1
are
1
not
1
so
1
unlucky
3
said
1
the
1
new
1
ruler
2
for
1
this
1
Palace
2
and
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
belong
2
to
1
us
1
and
1
we
1
can
1
do
1
just
1
as
1
we
1
please
2
When
1
I
1
remember
3
that
1
a
1
short
1
time
1
ago
2
I
1
was
1
up
1
on
1
a
1
pole
1
in
1
a
1
farmer's
2
cornfield
3
and
1
that
1
now
1
I
1
am
1
the
1
ruler
2
of
1
this
1
beautiful
4
City
2
I
1
am
1
quite
1
satisfied
3
with
1
my
1
lot
1
I
1
also
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
am
1
well-pleased
3
with
1
my
1
new
1
heart
2
and
1
really
3
that
1
was
1
the
1
only
2
thing
1
I
1
wished
1
in
1
all
1
the
1
world
1
For
1
my
1
part
1
I
1
am
1
content
2
in
1
knowing
2
I
1
am
1
as
1
brave
1
as
1
any
2
beast
2
that
1
ever
2
lived
1
if
1
not
1
braver
2
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
modestly
3
If
1
Dorothy
3
would
1
only
2
be
1
contented
2
to
1
live
1
in
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
continued
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
we
1
might
1
all
1
be
1
happy
2
together
3
But
1
I
1
do
1
n't
0
want
1
to
1
live
1
here
1
cried
1
Dorothy
3
I
1
want
1
to
1
go
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
live
1
with
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
and
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
Well
1
then
1
what
1
can
1
be
1
done
1
inquired
2
the
1
Woodman
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
decided
2
to
1
think
1
and
1
he
1
thought
1
so
1
hard
1
that
1
the
1
pins
1
and
1
needles
1
began
2
to
1
stick
1
out
1
of
1
his
1
brains
1
Finally
3
he
1
said
1
Why
1
not
1
call
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
and
1
ask
1
them
1
to
1
carry
2
you
1
over
2
the
1
desert
2
I
1
never
2
thought
1
of
1
that
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
joyfully
3
It
1
's
0
just
1
the
1
thing
1
I
1
'll
0
go
1
at
1
once
1
for
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
When
1
she
0
brought
1
it
1
into
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
she
0
spoke
1
the
1
magic
2
words
1
and
1
soon
1
the
1
band
1
of
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
flew
1
in
1
through
1
the
1
open
2
window
2
and
1
stood
1
beside
2
her
1
This
1
is
1
the
1
second
2
time
1
you
1
have
1
called
1
us
1
said
1
the
1
Monkey
2
King
1
bowing
2
before
2
the
1
little
1
girl
1
What
1
do
1
you
1
wish
1
I
1
want
1
you
1
to
1
fly
1
with
1
me
1
to
1
Kansas
2
said
1
Dorothy
3
But
1
the
1
Monkey
2
King
1
shook
1
his
1
head
2
That
1
can
1
not
1
be
1
done
1
he
1
said
1
We
1
belong
2
to
1
this
1
country
2
alone
2
and
1
can
1
not
1
leave
2
it
1
There
1
has
1
never
2
been
1
a
1
Winged
1
Monkey
2
in
1
Kansas
2
yet
1
and
1
I
1
suppose
2
there
1
never
2
will
1
be
1
for
1
they
1
do
1
n't
0
belong
2
there
1
We
1
shall
1
be
1
glad
1
to
1
serve
1
you
1
in
1
any
2
way
1
in
1
our
1
power
2
but
1
we
1
can
1
not
1
cross
1
the
1
desert
2
Good-bye
1
And
1
with
1
another
3
bow
1
the
1
Monkey
2
King
1
spread
2
his
1
wings
1
and
1
flew
1
away
2
through
1
the
1
window
2
followed
2
by
1
all
1
his
1
band
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
ready
3
to
1
cry
1
with
1
disappointment
4
I
1
have
1
wasted
1
the
1
charm
1
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
to
1
no
1
purpose
2
she
0
said
1
for
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
can
1
not
1
help
1
me
1
It
1
is
1
certainly
3
too
1
bad
1
said
1
the
1
tender-hearted
4
Woodman
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
was
1
thinking
2
again
2
and
1
his
1
head
2
bulged
1
out
1
so
1
horribly
3
that
1
Dorothy
3
feared
2
it
1
would
1
burst
1
Let
1
us
1
call
1
in
1
the
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
he
1
said
1
and
1
ask
1
his
1
advice
2
So
1
the
1
soldier
3
was
1
summoned
2
and
1
entered
2
the
1
Throne
1
Room
1
timidly
3
for
1
while
1
Oz
1
was
1
alive
2
he
1
never
2
was
1
allowed
2
to
1
come
1
farther
2
than
1
the
1
door
1
This
1
little
1
girl
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
to
1
the
1
soldier
3
wishes
1
to
1
cross
1
the
1
desert
2
How
1
can
1
she
0
do
1
so
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
tell
1
answered
2
the
1
soldier
3
for
1
nobody
3
has
1
ever
2
crossed
1
the
1
desert
2
unless
2
it
1
is
1
Oz
1
himself
2
Is
1
there
1
no
1
one
1
who
1
can
1
help
1
me
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
earnestly
4
Glinda
2
might
1
he
1
suggested
2
Who
1
is
1
Glinda
2
inquired
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
The
1
Witch
1
of
1
the
1
South
1
She
0
is
1
the
1
most
1
powerful
3
of
1
all
1
the
1
Witches
1
and
1
rules
1
over
2
the
1
Quadlings
2
Besides
2
her
1
castle
1
stands
1
on
1
the
1
edge
1
of
1
the
1
desert
2
so
1
she
0
may
1
know
1
a
1
way
1
to
1
cross
1
it
1
Glinda
2
is
1
a
1
Good
1
Witch
1
is
1
n't
0
she
0
asked
1
the
1
child
1
The
1
Quadlings
2
think
1
she
0
is
1
good
1
said
1
the
1
soldier
3
and
1
she
0
is
1
kind
1
to
1
everyone
3
I
1
have
1
heard
2
that
1
Glinda
2
is
1
a
1
beautiful
4
woman
2
who
1
knows
1
how
1
to
1
keep
1
young
1
in
1
spite
1
of
1
the
1
many
2
years
2
she
0
has
1
lived
1
How
1
can
1
I
1
get
1
to
1
her
1
castle
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
The
1
road
1
is
1
straight
1
to
1
the
1
South
1
he
1
answered
2
but
1
it
1
is
1
said
1
to
1
be
1
full
1
of
1
dangers
2
to
1
travelers
3
There
1
are
1
wild
1
beasts
2
in
1
the
1
woods
1
and
1
a
1
race
1
of
1
queer
1
men
1
who
1
do
1
not
1
like
1
strangers
2
to
1
cross
1
their
1
country
2
For
1
this
1
reason
3
none
1
of
1
the
1
Quadlings
2
ever
2
come
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
The
1
soldier
3
then
1
left
1
them
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
said
1
It
1
seems
1
in
1
spite
1
of
1
dangers
2
that
1
the
1
best
1
thing
1
Dorothy
3
can
1
do
1
is
1
to
1
travel
2
to
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
the
1
South
1
and
1
ask
1
Glinda
2
to
1
help
1
her
1
For
1
of
1
course
1
if
1
Dorothy
3
stays
1
here
1
she
0
will
1
never
2
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
You
1
must
1
have
1
been
1
thinking
2
again
2
remarked
2

Woodman
2
I
1
have
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
shall
1
go
1
with
1
Dorothy
3
declared
2
the
1
Lion
1
for
1
I
1
am
1
tired
1
of
1
your
1
city
2
and
1
long
1
for
1
the
1
woods
1
and
1
the
1
country
2
again
2
I
1
am
1
really
3
a
1
wild
1
beast
2
you
1
know
1
Besides
2
Dorothy
3
will
1
need
0
someone
2
to
1
protect
2
her
1
That
1
is
1
true
0
agreed
1
the
1
Woodman
2
My
1
axe
1
may
1
be
1
of
1
service
2
to
1
her
1
so
1
I
1
also
2
will
1
go
1
with
1
her
1
to
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
the
1
South
1
When
1
shall
1
we
1
start
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Are
1
you
1
going
1
they
1
asked
1
in
1
surprise
2
Certainly
3
If
1
it
1
was
1
n't
0
for
1
Dorothy
3
I
1
should
1
never
2
have
1
had
1
brains
1
She
0
lifted
1
me
1
from
1
the
1
pole
1
in
1
the
1
cornfield
3
and
1
brought
1
me
1
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
So
1
my
1
good
1
luck
1
is
1
all
1
due
0
to
1
her
1
and
1
I
1
shall
1
never
2
leave
2
her
1
until
2
she
0
starts
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
for
1
good
1
and
1
all
1
Thank
1
you
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
gratefully
4
You
1
are
1
all
1
very
2
kind
1
to
1
me
1
But
1
I
1
should
1
like
1
to
1
start
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
possible
2
We
1
shall
1
go
1
tomorrow
3
morning
2
returned
2
the
1
Scarecrow
3
So
1
now
1
let
1
us
1
all
1
get
1
ready
3
for
1
it
1
will
1
be
1
a
1
long
1
journey
2
The
1
next
1
morning
2
Dorothy
3
kissed
1
the
1
pretty
2
green
1
girl
1
good-bye
1
and
1
they
1
all
1
shook
1
hands
1
with
1
the
1
soldier
3
with
1
the
1
green
1
whiskers
2
who
1
had
1
walked
1
with
1
them
1
as
1
far
1
as
1
the
1
gate
1
When
1
the
1
Guardian
3
of
1
the
1
Gate
1
saw
1
them
1
again
2
he
1
wondered
2
greatly
3
that
1
they
1
could
1
leave
2
the
1
beautiful
4
City
2
to
1
get
1
into
2
new
1
trouble
1
But
1
he
1
at
1
once
1
unlocked
2
their
1
spectacles
2
which
1
he
1
put
1
back
1
into
2
the
1
green
1
box
1
and
1
gave
1
them
1
many
2
good
1
wishes
1
to
1
carry
2
with
1
them
1
You
1
are
1
now
1
our
1
ruler
2
he
1
said
1
to
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
so
1
you
1
must
1
come
1
back
1
to
1
us
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
possible
2
I
1
certainly
3
shall
1
if
1
I
1
am
1
able
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
replied
2
but
1
I
1
must
1
help
1
Dorothy
3
to
1
get
1
home
1
first
1
As
1
Dorothy
3
bade
1
the
1
good-natured
3
Guardian
3
a
1
last
1
farewell
3
she
0
said
1
I
1
have
1
been
1
very
2
kindly
2
treated
2
in
1
your
1
lovely
3
City
2
and
1
everyone
3
has
1
been
1
good
1
to
1
me
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
tell
1
you
1
how
1
grateful
3
I
1
am
1
Do
1
n't
0
try
1
my
1
dear
2
he
1
answered
2
We
1
should
1
like
1
to
1
keep
1
you
1
with
1
us
1
but
1
if
1
it
1
is
1
your
1
wish
1
to
1
return
2
to
1
Kansas
2
I
1
hope
1
you
1
will
1
find
1
a
1
way
1
He
1
then
1
opened
2
the
1
gate
1
of
1
the
1
outer
2
wall
1
and
1
they
1
walked
1
forth
1
and
1
started
1
upon
2
their
1
journey
2
The
1
sun
1
shone
1
brightly
2
as
1
our
1
friends
2
turned
1
their
1
faces
1
toward
2
the
1
Land
1
of
1
the
1
South
1
They
1
were
1
all
1
in
1
the
1
best
1
of
1
spirits
2
and
1
laughed
1
and
1
chatted
1
together
3
Dorothy
3
was
1
once
1
more
1
filled
1
with
1
the
1
hope
1
of
1
getting
2
home
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
were
1
glad
1
to
1
be
1
of
1
use
1
to
1
her
1
As
1
for
1
the
1
Lion
1
he
1
sniffed
1
the
1
fresh
1
air
1
with
1
delight
2
and
1
whisked
1
his
1
tail
1
from
1
side
1
to
1
side
1
in
1
pure
1
joy
1
at
1
being
1
in
1
the
1
country
2
again
2
while
1
Toto
2
ran
1
around
2
them
1
and
1
chased
1
the
1
moths
1
and
1
butterflies
3
barking
2
merrily
3
all
1
the
1
time
1
City
2
life
1
does
0
not
1
agree
2
with
1
me
1
at
1
all
1
remarked
2
the
1
Lion
1
as
1
they
1
walked
1
along
2
at
1
a
1
brisk
1
pace
1
I
1
have
1
lost
1
much
1
flesh
1
since
1
I
1
lived
1
there
1
and
1
now
1
I
1
am
1
anxious
2
for
1
a
1
chance
1
to
1
show
1
the
1
other
2
beasts
2
how
1
courageous
3
I
1
have
1
grown
1
They
1
now
1
turned
1
and
1
took
1
a
1
last
1
look
1
at
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
All
1
they
1
could
1
see
1
was
1
a
1
mass
1
of
1
towers
2
and
1
steeples
1
behind
2
the
1
green
1
walls
1
and
1
high
1
up
1
above
2
everything
4
the
1
spires
1
and
1
dome
1
of
1
the
1
Palace
2
of
1
Oz
1
Oz
1
was
1
not
1
such
1
a
1
bad
1
Wizard
2
after
2
all
1
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
as
1
he
1
felt
1
his
1
heart
2
rattling
2
around
2
in
1
his
1
breast
2
He
1
knew
1
how
1
to
1
give
1
me
1
brains
1
and
1
very
2
good
1
brains
1
too
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
If
1
Oz
1
had
1
taken
2
a
1
dose
1
of
1
the
1
same
1
courage
2
he
1
gave
1
me
1
added
1
the
1
Lion
1
he
1
would
1
have
1
been
1
a
1
brave
1
man
1
Dorothy
3
said
1
nothing
2
Oz
1
had
1
not
1
kept
1
the
1
promise
2
he
1
made
1
her
1
but
1
he
1
had
1
done
1
his
1
best
1
so
1
she
0
forgave
2
him
1
As
1
he
1
said
1
he
1
was
1
a
1
good
1
man
1
even
2
if
1
he
1
was
1
a
1
bad
1
Wizard
2
The
1
first
1
day
1
's
0
journey
2
was
1
through
1
the
1
green
1
fields
2
and
1
bright
1
flowers
2
that
1
stretched
1
about
2
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
on
1
every
3
side
1
They
1
slept
1
that
1
night
1
on
1
the
1
grass
1
with
1
nothing
2
but
1
the
1
stars
1
over
2
them
1
and
1
they
1
rested
1
very
2
well
1
indeed
1
In
1
the
1
morning
2
they
1
traveled
2
on
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
a
1
thick
1
wood
1
There
1
was
1
no
1
way
1
of
1
going
1
around
2
it
1
for
1
it
1
seemed
1
to
1
extend
2
to
1
the
1
right
1
and
1
left
1
as
1
far
1
as
1
they
1
could
1
see
1
and
1
besides
2
they
1
did
1
not
1
dare
1
change
1
the
1
direction
3
of
1
their
1
journey
2
for
1
fear
2
of
1
getting
2
lost
1
So
1
they
1
looked
1
for
1
the
1
place
1
where
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
easiest
4
to
1
get
1
into
2
the
1
forest
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
who
1
was
1
in
1
the
1
lead
2
finally
3
discovered
3
a
1
big
1
tree
1
with
1
such
1
wide-spreading
5
branches
1
that
1
there
1
was
1
room
1
for
1
the
1
party
2
to
1
pass
1
underneath
4
So
1
he
1
walked
1
forward
2
to
1
the
1
tree
1
but
1
just
1
as
1
he
1
came
1
under
2
the
1
first
1
branches
1
they
1
bent
1
down
1
and
1
twined
1
around
2
him
1
and
1
the
1
next
1
minute
2
he
1
was
1
raised
1
from
1
the
1
ground
1
and
1
flung
1
headlong
3
among
2
his
1
fellow
2
travelers
3
This
1
did
1
not
1
hurt
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
it
1
surprised
2
him
1
and
1
he
1
looked
1
rather
2
dizzy
2
when
1
Dorothy
3
picked
1
him
1
up
1
Here
1
is
1
another
3
space
1
between
2
the
1
trees
0
called
1
the
1
Lion
1
Let
1
me
1
try
1
it
1
first
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
for
1
it
1
does
0
n't
0
hurt
1
me
1
to
1
get
1
thrown
1
about
2
He
1
walked
1
up
1
to
1
another

tree
1
as
1
he
1
spoke
1
but
1
its
1
branches
1
immediately
6
seized
1
him
1
and
1
tossed
1
him
1
back
1
again
2
This
1
is
1
strange
1
exclaimed
2
Dorothy
3
What
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
The
1
trees
0
seem
1
to
1
have
1
made
1
up
1
their
1
minds
1
to
1
fight
1
us
1
and
1
stop
1
our
1
journey
2
remarked
2
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
believe
3
I
1
will
1
try
1
it
1
myself
2
said
1
the
1
Woodman
2
and
1
shouldering
3
his
1
axe
1
he
1
marched
1
up
1
to
1
the
1
first
1
tree
1
that
1
had
1
handled
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
so
1
roughly
2
When
1
a
1
big
1
branch
1
bent
1
down
1
to
1
seize
1
him
1
the
1
Woodman
2
chopped
1
at
1
it
1
so
1
fiercely
4
that
1
he
1
cut
1
it
1
in
1
two
1
At
1
once
1
the
1
tree
1
began
2
shaking
2
all
1
its
1
branches
1
as
1
if
1
in
1
pain
1
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
passed
1
safely
3
under
2
it
1
Come
1
on
1
he
1
shouted
1
to
1
the
1
others
2
Be
1
quick
1
They
1
all
1
ran
1
forward
2
and
1
passed
1
under
2
the
1
tree
1
without
2
injury
3
except
2
Toto
2
who
1
was
1
caught
1
by
1
a
1
small
1
branch
1
and
1
shaken
2
until
2
he
1
howled
1
But
1
the
1
Woodman
2
promptly
2
chopped
1
off
1
the
1
branch
1
and
1
set
1
the
1
little
1
dog
1
free
1
The
1
other
2
trees
0
of
1
the
1
forest
2
did
1
nothing
2
to
1
keep
1
them
1
back
1
so
1
they
1
made
1
up
1
their
1
minds
1
that
1
only
2
the
1
first
1
row
1
of
1
trees
0
could
1
bend
1
down
1
their
1
branches
1
and
1
that
1
probably
3
these
1
were
1
the
1
policemen
4
of
1
the
1
forest
2
and
1
given
2
this
1
wonderful
3
power
2
in
1
order
2
to
1
keep
1
strangers
2
out
1
of
1
it
1
The
1
four
1
travelers
3
walked
1
with
1
ease
2
through
1
the
1
trees
0
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
farther
2
edge
1
of
1
the
1
wood
1
Then
1
to
1
their
1
surprise
2
they
1
found
1
before
2
them
1
a
1
high
1
wall
1
which
1
seemed
1
to
1
be
1
made
1
of
1
white
1
china
2
It
1
was
1
smooth
1
like
1
the
1
surface
2
of
1
a
1
dish
1
and
1
higher
2
than
1
their
1
heads
2
What
1
shall
1
we
1
do
1
now
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
I
1
will
1
make
1
a
1
ladder
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
for
1
we
1
certainly
3
must
1
climb
1
over
2
the
1
wall
1
While
1
the
1
Woodman
2
was
1
making
2
a
1
ladder
2
from
1
wood
1
which
1
he
1
found
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
Dorothy
3
lay
1
down
1
and
1
slept
1
for
1
she
0
was
1
tired
1
by
1
the
1
long
1
walk
1
The
1
Lion
1
also
2
curled
1
himself
2
up
1
to
1
sleep
1
and
1
Toto
2
lay
1
beside
2
him
1
The
1
Scarecrow
3
watched
1
the
1
Woodman
2
while
1
he
1
worked
1
and
1
said
1
to
1
him
1
I
1
can
1
not
1
think
1
why
1
this
1
wall
1
is
1
here
1
nor
1
what
1
it
1
is
1
made
1
of
1
Rest
1
your
1
brains
1
and
1
do
1
not
1
worry
2
about
2
the
1
wall
1
replied
2
the
1
Woodman
2
When
1
we
1
have
1
climbed
1
over
2
it
1
we
1
shall
1
know
1
what
1
is
1
on
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
After
2
a
1
time
1
the
1
ladder
2
was
1
finished
2
It
1
looked
1
clumsy
2
but
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
was
1
sure
1
it
1
was
1
strong
1
and
1
would
1
answer
2
their
1
purpose
2
The
1
Scarecrow
3
waked
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
Toto
2
and
1
told
1
them
1
that
1
the
1
ladder
2
was
1
ready
3
The
1
Scarecrow
3
climbed
1
up
1
the
1
ladder
2
first
1
but
1
he
1
was
1
so
1
awkward
2
that
1
Dorothy
3
had
1
to
1
follow
2
close
1
behind
2
and
1
keep
1
him
1
from
1
falling
2
off
1
When
1
he
1
got
1
his
1
head
2
over
2
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
wall
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
said
1
Oh
1
my
1
Go
1
on
1
exclaimed
2
Dorothy
3
So
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
climbed
1
farther
2
up
1
and
1
sat
1
down
1
on
1
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
wall
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
put
1
her
1
head
2
over
2
and
1
cried
1
Oh
1
my
1
just
1
as
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
had
1
done
1
Then
1
Toto
2
came
1
up
1
and
1
immediately
6
began
2
to
1
bark
1
but
1
Dorothy
3
made
1
him
1
be
1
still
1
The
1
Lion
1
climbed
1
the
1
ladder
2
next
1
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
came
1
last
1
but
1
both
1
of
1
them
1
cried
1
Oh
1
my
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
they
1
looked
1
over
2
the
1
wall
1
When
1
they
1
were
1
all
1
sitting
2
in
1
a
1
row
1
on
1
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
wall
1
they
1
looked
1
down
1
and
1
saw
1
a
1
strange
1
sight
1
Before
2
them
1
was
1
a
1
great
2
stretch
1
of
1
country
2
having
2
a
1
floor
1
as
1
smooth
1
and
1
shining
2
and
1
white
1
as
1
the
1
bottom
2
of
1
a
1
big
1
platter
2
Scattered
2
around
2
were
1
many
2
houses
1
made
1
entirely
4
of
1
china
2
and
1
painted
1
in
1
the
1
brightest
2
colors
2
These
1
houses
1
were
1
quite
1
small
1
the
1
biggest
2
of
1
them
1
reaching
3
only
2
as
1
high
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
waist
1
There
1
were
1
also
2
pretty
2
little
1
barns
1
with
1
china
2
fences
1
around
2
them
1
and
1
many
2
cows
1
and
1
sheep
1
and
1
horses
1
and
1
pigs
1
and
1
chickens
2
all
1
made
1
of
1
china
2
were
1
standing
2
about
2
in
1
groups
1
But
1
the
1
strangest
2
of
1
all
1
were
1
the
1
people
1
who
1
lived
1
in
1
this
1
queer
1
country
2
There
1
were
1
milkmaids
2
and
1
shepherdesses
3
with
1
brightly
2
colored
2
bodices
2
and
1
golden
2
spots
1
all
1
over
2
their
1
gowns
1
and
1
princesses
2
with
1
most
1
gorgeous
2
frocks
1
of
1
silver
2
and
1
gold
1
and
1
purple
1
and
1
shepherds
2
dressed
1
in
1
knee
1
breeches
1
with
1
pink
1
and
1
yellow
2
and
1
blue
0
stripes
1
down
1
them
1
and
1
golden
2
buckles
1
on
1
their
1
shoes
0
and
1
princes
1
with
1
jeweled
2
crowns
1
upon
2
their
1
heads
2
wearing
3
ermine
2
robes
1
and
1
satin
2
doublets
2
and
1
funny
2
clowns
1
in
1
ruffled
1
gowns
1
with
1
round
1
red
0
spots
1
upon
2
their
1
cheeks
1
and
1
tall
1
pointed
1
caps
1
And
1
strangest
2
of
1
all
1
these
1
people
1
were
1
all
1
made
1
of
1
china
2
even
2
to
1
their
1
clothes
1
and
1
were
1
so
1
small
1
that
1
the
1
tallest
2
of
1
them
1
was
1
no
1
higher
2
than
1
Dorothy
3
's
0
knee
1
No
1
one
1
did
1
so
1
much
1
as
1
look
1
at
1
the
1
travelers
3
at
1
first
1
except
2
one
1
little
1
purple
1
china
2
dog
1
with
1
an
1
extra-large
3
head
2
which
1
came
1
to
1
the
1
wall
1
and
1
barked
1
at
1
them
1
in
1
a
1
tiny
2
voice
1
afterwards
3
running
2
away
2
again
2
How
1
shall
1
we
1
get
1
down
1
asked
1
Dorothy
3
They
1
found
1
the
1
ladder
2
so
1
heavy
3
they
1
could
1
not
1
pull
1
it
1
up
1
so
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
fell
1
off
1
the
1
wall
1
and
1
the
1
others
2
jumped
1
down
1
upon
2
him
1
so
1
that
1
the
1
hard
1
floor
1
would
1
not
1
hurt
1
their
1
feet
1
Of
1
course
1
they
1
took
1
pains
1
not
1
to
1
light
1
on
1
his
1
head
2
and
1
get
1
the
1
pins
1
in
1
their
1
feet
1
When
1
all
1
were
1
safely
3
down
1
they
1
picked
1
up
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
whose
1
body
2
was
1
quite
1
flattened
2
out
1
and
1
patted
1
his
1
straw
1
into
2
shape
1
again
2
We
1
must
1
cross
1
this
1
strange
1
place
1
in
1
order
2
to
1
get
1
to
1
the
1
other
2
side
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
for
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
unwise
2
for
1
us
1
to
1
go
1
any
2
other
2
way
1
except
2
due
0
South
1
They
1
began
2
walking
2
through
1
the
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
china
2
people
1
and
1
the
1
first
1
thing
1
they
1
came
1
to
1
was
1
a
1
china
2
milkmaid
2
milking
2
a
1
china
2
cow
1
As
1
they
1
drew
1
near
2
the
1
cow
1
suddenly
3
gave
1
a
1
kick
1
and
1
kicked
1
over
2
the
1
stool
1
the
1
pail
1
and
1
even
2
the
1
milkmaid
2
herself
2
and
1
all
1
fell
1
on
1
the
1
china
2
ground
1
with
1
a
1
great
2
clatter
2
Dorothy
3
was
1
shocked
1
to
1
see
1
that
1
the
1
cow
1
had
1
broken
2
her
1
leg
1
off
1
and
1
that
1
the
1
pail
1
was
1
lying
1
in
1
several
3
small
1
pieces
2
while
1
the
1
poor
1
milkmaid
2
had
1
a
1
nick
1
in
1
her
1
left
1
elbow
2
There
1
cried
1
the
1
milkmaid
2
angrily
3
See
1
what
1
you
1
have
1
done
1
My
1
cow
1
has
1
broken
2
her
1
leg
1
and
1
I
1
must
1
take
1
her
1
to
1
the
1
mender
2
's
0
shop
1
and
1
have
1
it
1
glued
0
on
1
again
2
What
1
do
1
you
1
mean
2
by
1
coming
2
here
1
and
1
frightening
3
my
1
cow
1
I
1
'm
0
very
2
sorry
2
returned
2
Dorothy
3
Please
2
forgive
2
us
1
But
1
the
1
pretty
2
milkmaid
2
was
1
much
1
too
1
vexed
1
to
1
make
1
any
2
answer
2
She
0
picked
1
up
1
the
1
leg
1
sulkily
3
and
1
led
0
her
1
cow
1
away
2
the
1
poor
1
animal
3
limping
2
on
1
three
1
legs
1
As
1
she
0
left
1
them
1
the
1
milkmaid
2
cast
1
many
2
reproachful
3
glances
1
over
2
her
1
shoulder
2
at
1
the
1
clumsy
2
strangers
2
holding
2
her
1
nicked
1
elbow
2
close
1
to
1
her
1
side
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
quite
1
grieved
2
at
1
this
1
mishap
2
We
1
must
1
be
1
very
2
careful
3
here
1
said
1
the
1
kind-hearted
3
Woodman
2
or
1
we
1
may
1
hurt
1
these
1
pretty
2
little
1
people
1
so
1
they
1
will
1
never
2
get
1
over
2
it
1
A
1
little
1
farther
2
on
1
Dorothy
3
met
1
a
1
most
1
beautifully
5
dressed
1
young
1
Princess
2
who
1
stopped
1
short
1
as
1
she
0
saw
1
the
1
strangers
2
and
1
started
1
to
1
run
1
away
2
Dorothy
3
wanted
1
to
1
see
1
more
1
of
1
the
1
Princess
2
so
1
she
0
ran
1
after
2
her
1
But
1
the
1
china
2
girl
1
cried
1
out
1
Do
1
n't
0
chase
1
me
1
Do
1
n't
0
chase
1
me
1
She
0
had
1
such
1
a
1
frightened
2
little
1
voice
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
stopped
1
and
1
said
1
Why
1
not
1
Because
2
answered
2
the
1
Princess
2
also
2
stopping
2
a
1
safe
1
distance
2
away
2
if
1
I
1
run
1
I
1
may
1
fall
1
down
1
and
1
break
2
myself
2
But
1
could
1
you
1
not
1
be
1
mended
1
asked
1
the
1
girl
1
Oh
1
yes
0
but
1
one
1
is
1
never
2
so
1
pretty
2
after
2
being
1
mended
1
you
1
know
1
replied
2
the
1
Princess
2
I
1
suppose
2
not
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
Now
1
there
1
is
1
Mr
0
Joker
2
one
1
of
1
our
1
clowns
1
continued
2
the
1
china
2
lady
2
who
1
is
1
always
2
trying
1
to
1
stand
1
upon
2
his
1
head
2
He
1
has
1
broken
2
himself
2
so
1
often
2
that
1
he
1
is
1
mended
1
in
1
a
1
hundred
1
places
1
and
1
does
0
n't
0
look
1
at
1
all
1
pretty
2
Here
1
he
1
comes
1
now
1
so
1
you
1
can
1
see
1
for
1
yourself
2
Indeed
1
a
1
jolly
2
little
1
clown
1
came
1
walking
2
toward
2
them
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
could
1
see
1
that
1
in
1
spite
1
of
1
his
1
pretty
2
clothes
1
of
1
red
0
and
1
yellow
2
and
1
green
1
he
1
was
1
completely
4
covered
2
with
1
cracks
1
running
2
every
3
which
1
way
1
and
1
showing
2
plainly
2
that
1
he
1
had
1
been
1
mended
1
in
1
many
2
places
1
The
1
Clown
1
put
1
his
1
hands
1
in
1
his
1
pockets
2
and
1
after
2
puffing
2
out
1
his
1
cheeks
1
and
1
nodding
2
his
1
head
2
at
1
them
1
saucily
3
he
1
said
1
My
1
lady
2
fair
1
Why
1
do
1
you
1
stare
1
At
1
poor
1
old
1
Mr
0
Joker
2
You
1
're
0
quite
1
as
1
stiff
1
And
1
prim
1
as
1
if
1
You
1
'd
0
eaten
3
up
1
a
1
poker
2
Be
1
quiet
2
sir
1
said
1
the
1
Princess
2
Ca
1
n't
0
you
1
see
1
these
1
are
1
strangers
2
and
1
should
1
be
1
treated
2
with
1
respect
2
Well
1
that
1
's
0
respect
2
I
1
expect
2
declared
2
the
1
Clown
1
and
1
immediately
6
stood
1
upon
2
his
1
head
2
Do
1
n't
0
mind
1
Mr
0
Joker
2
said
1
the
1
Princess
2
to
1
Dorothy
3
He
1
is
1
considerably
5
cracked
1
in
1
his
1
head
2
and
1
that
1
makes
1
him
1
foolish
2
Oh
1
I
1
do
1
n't
0
mind
1
him
1
a
1
bit
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
But
1
you
1
are
1
so
1
beautiful
4
she
0
continued
2
that
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
I
1
could
1
love
1
you
1
dearly
3
Wo
1
n't
0
you
1
let
1
me
1
carry
2
you
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
and
1
stand
1
you
1
on
1
Aunt
1
Em's
1
mantel
2
I
1
could
1
carry
2
you
1
in
1
my
1
basket
2
That
1
would
1
make
1
me
1
very
2
unhappy
3
answered
2
the
1
china
2
Princess
2
You
1
see
1
here
1
in
1
our
1
country
2
we
1
live
1
contentedly
4
and
1
can
1
talk
1
and
1
move
1
around
2
as
1
we
1
please
2
But
1
whenever
3
any
2
of
1
us
1
are
1
taken
2
away
2
our
1
joints
1
at
1
once
1
stiffen
2
and
1
we
1
can
1
only
2
stand
1
straight
1
and
1
look
1
pretty
2
Of
1
course
1
that
1
is
1
all
1
that
1
is
1
expected
2
of
1
us
1
when
1
we
1
are
1
on
1
mantels
2
and
1
cabinets
3
and
1
drawing-room
3
tables
1
but
1
our
1
lives
1
are
1
much
1
pleasanter
4
here
1
in
1
our
1
own
1
country
2
I
1
would
1
not
1
make
1
you
1
unhappy
3
for
1
all
1
the
1
world
1
exclaimed
2
Dorothy
3
So
1
I
1
'll
0
just
1
say
1
good-bye
1
Good-bye
1
replied
2
the
1
Princess
2
They
1
walked
1
carefully
4
through
1
the
1
china
2
country
2
The
1
little
1
animals
3
and
1
all
1
the
1
people
1
scampered
2
out
1
of
1
their
1
way
1
fearing
3
the
1
strangers
2
would
1
break
2
them
1
and
1
after
2
an
1
hour
1
or
1
so
1
the
1
travelers
3
reached
2
the
1
other
2
side
1
of
1
the
1
country
2
and
1
came
1
to
1
another
3
china
2
wall
1
It
1
was
1
not
1
so
1
high
1
as
1
the
1
first
1
however
3
and
1
by
1
standing
2
upon
2
the
1
Lion
1
's
0
back
1
they
1
all
1
managed
2
to
1
scramble
1
to
1
the
1
top
1
Then
1
the
1
Lion
1
gathered
2
his
1
legs
1
under
2
him
1
and
1
jumped
1
on
1
the
1
wall
1
but
1
just
1
as
1
he
1
jumped
1
he
1
upset
2
a
1
china
2
church
1
with
1
his
1
tail
1
and
1
smashed
1
it
1
all
1
to
1
pieces
2
That
1
was
1
too
1
bad
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
but
1
really
3
I
1
think
1
we
1
were
1
lucky
2
in
1
not
1
doing
1
these
1
little
1
people
1
more
1
harm
1
than
1
breaking
3
a
1
cow
1
's
0
leg
1
and
1
a
1
church
1
They
1
are
1
all
1
so
1
brittle
1
They
1
are
1
indeed
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
I
1
am
1
thankful
2
I
1
am
1
made
1
of
1
straw
1
and
1
can
1
not
1
be
1
easily
4
damaged
2
There
1
are
1
worse
1
things
1
in
1
the
1
world
1
than
1
being

After
2
climbing
2
down
1
from
1
the
1
china
2
wall
1
the
1
travelers
3
found
1
themselves
2
in
1
a
1
disagreeable
4
country
2
full
1
of
1
bogs
1
and
1
marshes
1
and
1
covered
2
with
1
tall
1
rank
1
grass
1
It
1
was
1
difficult
3
to
1
walk
1
without
2
falling
2
into
2
muddy
2
holes
1
for
1
the
1
grass
1
was
1
so
1
thick
1
that
1
it
1
hid
1
them
1
from
1
sight
1
However
3
by
1
carefully
4
picking
2
their
1
way
1
they
1
got
1
safely
3
along
2
until
2
they
1
reached
2
solid
2
ground
1
But
1
here
1
the
1
country
2
seemed
1
wilder
2
than
1
ever
2
and
1
after
2
a
1
long
1
and
1
tiresome
3
walk
1
through
1
the
1
underbrush
3
they
1
entered
2
another
3
forest
2
where
1
the
1
trees
0
were
1
bigger
2
and
1
older
2
than
1
any
2
they
1
had
1
ever
2
seen
1
This
1
forest
2
is
1
perfectly
3
delightful
3
declared
2
the
1
Lion
1
looking
2
around
2
him
1
with
1
joy
1
Never
2
have
1
I
1
seen
1
a
1
more
1
beautiful
4
place
1
It
1
seems
1
gloomy
2
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Not
1
a
1
bit
1
of
1
it
1
answered
2
the
1
Lion
1
I
1
should
1
like
1
to
1
live
1
here
1
all
1
my
1
life
1
See
1
how
1
soft
1
the
1
dried
1
leaves
2
are
1
under
2
your
1
feet
1
and
1
how
1
rich
1
and
1
green
1
the
1
moss
1
is
1
that
1
clings
1
to
1
these
1
old
1
trees
0
Surely
3
no
1
wild
1
beast
2
could
1
wish
1
a
1
pleasanter
4
home
1
Perhaps
2
there
1
are
1
wild
1
beasts
2
in
1
the
1
forest
2
now
1
said
1
Dorothy
3
I
1
suppose
2
there
1
are
1
returned
2
the
1
Lion
1
but
1
I
1
do
1
not
1
see
1
any
2
of
1
them
1
about
2
They
1
walked
1
through
1
the
1
forest
2
until
2
it
1
became
2
too
1
dark
1
to
1
go
1
any
2
farther
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
Toto
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
lay
1
down
1
to
1
sleep
1
while
1
the
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
kept
1
watch
1
over
2
them
1
as
1
usual
2
When
1
morning
2
came
1
they
1
started
1
again
2
Before
2
they
1
had
1
gone
1
far
1
they
1
heard
2
a
1
low
1
rumble
1
as
1
of
1
the
1
growling
2
of
1
many
2
wild
1
animals
3
Toto
2
whimpered
2
a
1
little
1
but
1
none
1
of
1
the
1
others
2
was
1
frightened
2
and
1
they
1
kept
1
along
2
the
1
well-trodden
3
path
1
until
2
they
1
came
1
to
1
an
1
opening
3
in
1
the
1
wood
1
in
1
which
1
were
1
gathered
2
hundreds
2
of
1
beasts
2
of
1
every
3
variety
4
There
1
were
1
tigers
2
and
1
elephants
3
and
1
bears
2
and
1
wolves
1
and
1
foxes
1
and
1
all
1
the
1
others
2
in
1
the
1
natural
3
history
3
and
1
for
1
a
1
moment
2
Dorothy
3
was
1
afraid
2
But
1
the
1
Lion
1
explained
2
that
1
the
1
animals
3
were
1
holding
2
a
1
meeting
2
and
1
he
1
judged
1
by
1
their
1
snarling
2
and
1
growling
2
that
1
they
1
were
1
in
1
great
2
trouble
1
As
1
he
1
spoke
1
several
3
of
1
the
1
beasts
2
caught
1
sight
1
of
1
him
1
and
1
at
1
once
1
the
1
great
2
assemblage
3
hushed
1
as
1
if
1
by
1
magic
2
The
1
biggest
2
of
1
the
1
tigers
2
came
1
up
1
to
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
bowed
1
saying
1
Welcome
2
O
1
King
1
of
1
Beasts
2
You
1
have
1
come
1
in
1
good
1
time
1
to
1
fight
1
our
1
enemy
3
and
1
bring
1
peace
2
to
1
all
1
the
1
animals
3
of
1
the
1
forest
2
once
1
more
1
What
1
is
1
your
1
trouble
1
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
quietly
3
We
1
are
1
all
1
threatened
3
answered
2
the
1
tiger
2
by
1
a
1
fierce
2
enemy
3
which
1
has
1
lately
3
come
1
into
2
this
1
forest
2
It
1
is
1
a
1
most
1
tremendous
3
monster
2
like
1
a
1
great
2
spider
2
with
1
a
1
body
2
as
1
big
1
as
1
an
1
elephant
3
and
1
legs
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
a
1
tree
1
trunk
1
It
1
has
1
eight
1
of
1
these
1
long
1
legs
1
and
1
as
1
the
1
monster
2
crawls
1
through
1
the
1
forest
2
he
1
seizes
1
an
1
animal
3
with
1
a
1
leg
1
and
1
drags
1
it
1
to
1
his
1
mouth
1
where
1
he
1
eats
2
it
1
as
1
a
1
spider
2
does
0
a
1
fly
1
Not
1
one
1
of
1
us
1
is
1
safe
1
while
1
this
1
fierce
2
creature
3
is
1
alive
2
and
1
we
1
had
1
called
1
a
1
meeting
2
to
1
decide
2
how
1
to
1
take
1
care
1
of
1
ourselves
2
when
1
you
1
came
1
among
2
us
1
The
1
Lion
1
thought
1
for
1
a
1
moment
2
Are
1
there
1
any
2
other
2
lions
1
in
1
this
1
forest
2
he
1
asked
1
No
1
there
1
were
1
some
1
but
1
the
1
monster
2
has
1
eaten
3
them
1
all
1
And
1
besides
2
they
1
were
1
none
1
of
1
them
1
nearly
3
so
1
large
1
and
1
brave
1
as
1
you
1
If
1
I
1
put
1
an
1
end
1
to
1
your
1
enemy
3
will
1
you
1
bow
1
down
1
to
1
me
1
and
1
obey
2
me
1
as
1
King
1
of
1
the
1
Forest
2
inquired
2
the
1
Lion
1
We
1
will
1
do
1
that
1
gladly
2
returned
2
the
1
tiger
2
and
1
all
1
the
1
other
2
beasts
2
roared
1
with
1
a
1
mighty
2
roar
1
We
1
will
1
Where
1
is
1
this
1
great
2
spider
2
of
1
yours
1
now
1
asked
1
the
1
Lion
1
Yonder
2
among
2
the
1
oak
1
trees
0
said
1
the
1
tiger
2
pointing
2
with
1
his
1
forefoot
3
Take
1
good
1
care
1
of
1
these
1
friends
2
of
1
mine
1
said
1
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
I
1
will
1
go
1
at
1
once
1
to
1
fight
1
the
1
monster
2
He
1
bade
1
his
1
comrades
2
good-bye
1
and
1
marched
1
proudly
2
away
2
to
1
do
1
battle
1
with
1
the
1
enemy
3
The
1
great
2
spider
2
was
1
lying
1
asleep
2
when
1
the
1
Lion
1
found
1
him
1
and
1
it
1
looked
1
so
1
ugly
2
that
1
its
1
foe
0
turned
1
up
1
his
1
nose
1
in
1
disgust
2
Its
1
legs
1
were
1
quite
1
as
1
long
1
as
1
the
1
tiger
2
had
1
said
1
and
1
its
1
body
2
covered
2
with
1
coarse
1
black
1
hair
1
It
1
had
1
a
1
great
2
mouth
1
with
1
a
1
row
1
of
1
sharp
1
teeth
1
a
1
foot
1
long
1
but
1
its
1
head
2
was
1
joined
1
to
1
the
1
pudgy
2
body
2
by
1
a
1
neck
1
as
1
slender
2
as
1
a
1
wasp
1
's
0
waist
1
This
1
gave
1
the
1
Lion
1
a
1
hint
1
of
1
the
1
best
1
way
1
to
1
attack
2
the
1
creature
3
and
1
as
1
he
1
knew
1
it
1
was
1
easier
4
to
1
fight
1
it
1
asleep
2
than
1
awake
2
he
1
gave
1
a
1
great
2
spring
1
and
1
landed
1
directly
3
upon
2
the
1
monster
2
's
0
back
1
Then
1
with
1
one
1
blow
1
of
1
his
1
heavy
3
paw
1
all
1
armed
1
with
1
sharp
1
claws
1
he
1
knocked
1
the
1
spider
2
's
0
head
2
from
1
its
1
body
2
Jumping
2
down
1
he
1
watched
1
it
1
until
2
the
1
long
1
legs
1
stopped
1
wiggling
2
when
1
he
1
knew
1
it
1
was
1
quite
1
dead
2
The
1
Lion
1
went
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
opening
3
where
1
the
1
beasts
2
of
1
the
1
forest
2
were
1
waiting
2
for
1
him
1
and
1
said
1
proudly
2
You
1
need
0
fear
2
your
1
enemy
3
no
1
longer
2
Then
1
the
1
beasts
2
bowed
1
down
1
to
1
the
1
Lion
1
as
1
their
1
King
1
and
1
he
1
promised
2
to
1
come
1
back
1
and
1
rule
1
over
2
them
1
as
1
soon
1
as
1
Dorothy
3
was
1
safely
3
on
1
her
1
way
1
to
1
Kansas
2
The
1
four
1
travelers
3
passed
1
through
1
the
1
rest
1
of
1
the
1
forest
2
in
1
safety
3
and
1
when
1
they
1
came
1
out
1
from
1
its
1
gloom
1
saw
1
before
2
them
1
a
1
steep
1
hill
1
covered
2
from
1
top
1
to
1
bottom
2
with
1
great
2
pieces
2
of
1
rock
1
That
1
will
1
be
1
a
1
hard
1
climb
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
we
1
must
1
get
1
over
2
the
1
hill
1
nevertheless
4
So
1
he
1
led
0
the
1
way
1
and
1
the
1
others
2
followed
2
They
1
had
1
nearly
3
reached
2
the
1
first
1
rock
1
when
1
they
1
heard
2
a
1
rough
1
voice
1
cry
1
out
1
Keep
1
back
1
Who
1
are
1
you
1
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
Then
1
a
1
head
2
showed
1
itself
2
over
2
the
1
rock
1
and
1
the
1
same
1
voice
1
said
1
This
1
hill
1
belongs
2
to
1
us
1
and
1
we
1
do
1
n't
0
allow
2
anyone
2
to
1
cross
1
it
1
But
1
we
1
must
1
cross
1
it
1
said
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
We
1
're
0
going
1
to
1
the
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
Quadlings
2
But
1
you
1
shall
1
not
1
replied
2
the
1
voice
1
and
1
there
1
stepped
1
from
1
behind
2
the
1
rock
1
the
1
strangest
2
man
1
the
1
travelers
3
had
1
ever
2
seen
1
He
1
was
1
quite
1
short
1
and
1
stout
1
and
1
had
1
a
1
big
1
head
2
which
1
was
1
flat
1
at
1
the
1
top
1
and
1
supported
2
by
1
a
1
thick
1
neck
1
full
1
of
1
wrinkles
1
But
1
he
1
had
1
no
1
arms
1
at
1
all
1
and
1
seeing
1
this
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
did
1
not
1
fear
2
that
1
so
1
helpless
2
a
1
creature
3
could
1
prevent
2
them
1
from
1
climbing
2
the
1
hill
1
So
1
he
1
said
1
I'm
1
sorry
2
not
1
to
1
do
1
as
1
you
1
wish
1
but
1
we
1
must
1
pass
1
over
2
your
1
hill
1
whether
2
you
1
like
1
it
1
or
1
not
1
and
1
he
1
walked
1
boldly
2
forward
2
As
1
quick
1
as
1
lightning
2
the
1
man
1
's
0
head
2
shot
1
forward
2
and
1
his
1
neck
1
stretched
1
out
1
until
2
the
1
top
1
of
1
the
1
head
2
where
1
it
1
was
1
flat
1
struck
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
in
1
the
1
middle
1
and
1
sent
1
him
1
tumbling
2
over
2
and
1
over
2
down
1
the
1
hill
1
Almost
2
as
1
quickly
2
as
1
it
1
came
1
the
1
head
2
went
1
back
1
to
1
the
1
body
2
and
1
the
1
man
1
laughed
1
harshly
2
as
1
he
1
said
1
It
1
is
1
n't
0
as
1
easy
3
as
1
you
1
think
1
A
1
chorus
2
of
1
boisterous
3
laughter
2
came
1
from
1
the
1
other
2
rocks
1
and
1
Dorothy
3
saw
1
hundreds
2
of
1
the
1
armless
2
Hammer-Heads
4
upon
2
the
1
hillside
2
one
1
behind
2
every
3
rock
1
The
1
Lion
1
became
2
quite
1
angry
2
at
1
the
1
laughter
2
caused
1
by
1
the
1
Scarecrow's
3
mishap
2
and
1
giving
2
a
1
loud
1
roar
1
that
1
echoed
1
like
1
thunder
2
he
1
dashed
1
up
1
the
1
hill
1
Again
2
a
1
head
2
shot
1
swiftly
2
out
1
and
1
the
1
great
2
Lion
1
went
1
rolling
2
down
1
the
1
hill
1
as
1
if
1
he
1
had
1
been
1
struck
1
by
1
a
1
cannon
2
ball
1
Dorothy
3
ran
1
down
1
and
1
helped
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
to
1
his
1
feet
1
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
came
1
up
1
to
1
her
1
feeling
2
rather
2
bruised
1
and
1
sore
1
and
1
said
1
It
1
is
1
useless
3
to
1
fight
1
people
1
with
1
shooting
2
heads
2
no
1
one
1
can
1
withstand
2
them
1
What
1
can
1
we
1
do
1
then
1
she
0
asked
1
Call
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
suggested
2
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
You
1
have
1
still
1
the
1
right
1
to
1
command
2
them
1
once
1
more
1
Very
2
well
1
she
0
answered
2
and
1
putting
2
on
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
she
0
uttered
2
the
1
magic
2
words
1
The
1
Monkeys
2
were
1
as
1
prompt
1
as
1
ever
2
and
1
in
1
a
1
few
1
moments
2
the
1
entire
2
band
1
stood
1
before
2
her
1
What
1
are
1
your
1
commands
2
inquired
2
the
1
King
1
of
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
bowing
2
low
1
Carry
2
us
1
over
2
the
1
hill
1
to
1
the
1
country
2
of
1
the
1
Quadlings
2
answered
2
the
1
girl
1
It
1
shall
1
be
1
done
1
said
1
the
1
King
1
and
1
at
1
once
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
caught
1
the
1
four
1
travelers
3
and
1
Toto
2
up
1
in
1
their
1
arms
1
and
1
flew
1
away
2
with
1
them
1
As
1
they
1
passed
1
over
2
the
1
hill
1
the
1
Hammer-Heads
4
yelled
1
with
1
vexation
3
and
1
shot
1
their
1
heads
2
high
1
in
1
the
1
air
1
but
1
they
1
could
1
not
1
reach
2
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
which
1
carried
2
Dorothy
3
and
1
her
1
comrades
2
safely
3
over
2
the
1
hill
1
and
1
set
1
them
1
down
1
in
1
the
1
beautiful
4
country
2
of

the

This

is
1
the
1
last
1
time
1
you
1
can
1
summon
2
us

said
1
the

leader
3
to

Dorothy

so
1
good-bye

good

1
Good-bye

thank

you
1
very

much
1
returned
2
the
1
girl
1
and
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
rose
1
into

the

were

The

country
2
of
1
the

Quadlings
2
seemed
1
rich
1

There

was
1
field

The

down

a

Take

across

the

as

Dorothy

approached
2
one

of

them

said

to

her
1
Why

you

To

Let

They

Castle
1
After
2
a
1
few
1
moments
2
she
0
came
1
back
1
to
1
say
1
that
1
Dorothy
3
and
1
the
1
others
2
were
1
to
1
be
1
admitted
2
at
1
once
1
Before
2
they
1
went
1
to
1
see
1
Glinda
2
however
3
they
1
were
1
taken
2
to
1
a
1
room
1
of
1
the
1
Castle
1
where
1
Dorothy
3
washed
1
her
1
face
1
and
1
combed
1
her
1
hair
1
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
shook
1
the
1
dust
1
out
1
of
1
his
1
mane
1
and
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
patted
1
himself
2
into
2
his
1
best
1
shape
1
and
1
the
1
Woodman
2
polished
2
his
1
tin
1
and
1
oiled
1
his
1
joints
1
When
1
they
1
were
1
all
1
quite
1
presentable
3
they
1
followed
2
the
1
soldier
3
girl
1
into
2
a
1
big
1
room
1
where
1
the
1
Witch
1
Glinda
2
sat
1
upon
2
a
1
throne
1
of
1
rubies
2
She
0
was
1
both
1
beautiful
4
and
1
young
1
to
1
their
1
eyes
0
Her
1
hair
1
was
1
a
1
rich
1
red
0
in
1
color
2
and
1
fell
1
in
1
flowing
2
ringlets
2
over
2
her
1
shoulders
2
Her
1
dress
1
was
1
pure
1
white
1
but
1
her
1
eyes
0
were
1
blue
0
and
1
they
1
looked
1
kindly
2
upon
2
the
1
little
1
girl
1
What
1
can
1
I
1
do
1
for
1
you
1
my
1
child
1
she
0
asked
1
Dorothy
3
told
1
the
1
Witch
1
all
1
her
1
story
2
how
1
the
1
cyclone
2
had
1
brought
1
her
1
to
1
the
1
Land
1
of
1
Oz
1
how
1
she
0
had
1
found
1
her
1
companions
3
and
1
of
1
the
1
wonderful
3
adventures
3
they
1
had
1
met
1
with
1
My
1
greatest
3
wish
1
now
1
she
0
added
1
is
1
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
for
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
will
1
surely
3
think
1
something
3
dreadful
3
has
1
happened
2
to
1
me
1
and
1
that
1
will
1
make
1
her
1
put
1
on
1
mourning
2
and
1
unless
2
the
1
crops
1
are
1
better
2
this
1
year
2
than
1
they
1
were
1
last
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
Uncle
1
Henry
2
can
1
not
1
afford
2
it
1
Glinda
2
leaned
2
forward
2
and
1
kissed
1
the
1
sweet
1
upturned
2
face
1
of
1
the
1
loving
2
little
1
girl
1
Bless
1
your
1
dear
2
heart
2
she
0
said
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
I
1
can
1
tell
1
you
1
of
1
a
1
way
1
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
Then
1
she
0
added
1
But
1
if
1
I
1
do
1
you
1
must
1
give
1
me
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
Willingly
3
exclaimed
2
Dorothy
3
indeed
1
it
1
is
1
of
1
no
1
use
1
to
1
me
1
now
1
and
1
when
1
you
1
have
1
it
1
you
1
can
1
command
2
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
three
1
times
1
And
1
I
1
think
1
I
1
shall
1
need
0
their
1
service
2
just
1
those
1
three
1
times
1
answered
2
Glinda
2
smiling
2
Dorothy
3
then
1
gave
1
her
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
and
1
the
1
Witch
1
said
1
to
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
What
1
will
1
you
1
do
1
when
1
Dorothy
3
has
1
left
1
us
1
I
1
will
1
return
2
to
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
he
1
replied
2
for
1
Oz
1
has
1
made
1
me
1
its
1
ruler
2
and
1
the
1
people
1
like
1
me
1
The
1
only
2
thing
1
that
1
worries
2
me
1
is
1
how
1
to
1
cross
1
the
1
hill
1
of
1
the
1
Hammer-Heads
4
By
1
means
2
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
I
1
shall
1
command
2
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
to
1
carry
2
you
1
to
1
the
1
gates
1
of
1
the
1
Emerald
3
City
2
said
1
Glinda
2
for
1
it
1
would
1
be
1
a
1
shame
1
to
1
deprive
2
the
1
people
1
of
1
so
1
wonderful
3
a
1
ruler
2
Am
1
I
1
really
3
wonderful
3
asked
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
You
1
are
1
unusual
3
replied
2
Glinda
2
Turning
2
to
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
she
0
asked
1
What
1
will
1
become
2
of
1
you
1
when
1
Dorothy
3
leaves
2
this
1
country
2
He
1
leaned
2
on
1
his
1
axe
1
and
1
thought
1
a
1
moment
2
Then
1
he
1
said
1
The
1
Winkies
2
were
1
very
2
kind
1
to
1
me
1
and
1
wanted
1
me
1
to
1
rule
1
over
2
them
1
after
2
the
1
Wicked
1
Witch
1
died
1
I
1
am
1
fond
1
of
1
the
1
Winkies
2
and
1
if
1
I
1
could
1
get
1
back
1
again
2
to
1
the
1
Country
2
of
1
the
1
West
1
I
1
should
1
like
1
nothing
2
better
2
than
1
to
1
rule
1
over
2
them
1
forever
3
My
1
second
2
command
2
to
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
said
1
Glinda
2
will
1
be
1
that
1
they
1
carry
2
you
1
safely
3
to
1
the
1
land
1
of
1
the
1
Winkies
2
Your
1
brain
1
may
1
not
1
be
1
so
1
large
1
to
1
look
1
at
1
as
1
those
1
of
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
but
1
you
1
are
1
really
3
brighter
2
than
1
he
1
is
1
when
1
you
1
are
1
well
1
polished
2
and
1
I
1
am
1
sure
1
you
1
will
1
rule
1
the
1
Winkies
2
wisely
3
and
1
well
1
Then
1
the
1
Witch
1
looked
1
at
1
the
1
big
1
shaggy
2
Lion
1
and
1
asked
1
When
1
Dorothy
3
has
1
returned
2
to
1
her
1
own
1
home
1
what
1
will
1
become
2
of
1
you
1
Over
2
the
1
hill
1
of
1
the
1
Hammer-Heads
4
he
1
answered
2
lies
1
a
1
grand
1
old
1
forest
2
and
1
all
1
the
1
beasts
2
that
1
live
1
there
1
have
1
made
1
me
1
their
1
King
1
If
1
I
1
could
1
only
2
get
1
back
1
to
1
this
1
forest
2
I
1
would
1
pass
1
my
1
life
1
very
2
happily
3
there
1
My
1
third
1
command
2
to
1
the
1
Winged
1
Monkeys
2
said
1
Glinda
2
shall
1
be
1
to
1
carry
2
you
1
to
1
your
1
forest
2
Then
1
having
2
used
1
up
1
the
1
powers
2
of
1
the
1
Golden
2
Cap
1
I
1
shall
1
give
1
it
1
to
1
the
1
King
1
of
1
the
1
Monkeys
2
that
1
he
1
and
1
his
1
band
1
may
1
thereafter
4
be
1
free
1
for
1
evermore
3
The
1
Scarecrow
3
and
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
and
1
the
1
Lion
1
now
1
thanked
1
the
1
Good
1
Witch
1
earnestly
4
for
1
her
1
kindness
2
and
1
Dorothy
3
exclaimed
2
You
1
are
1
certainly
3
as
1
good
1
as
1
you
1
are
1
beautiful
4
But
1
you
1
have
1
not
1
yet
1
told
1
me
1
how
1
to
1
get
1
back
1
to
1
Kansas
2
Your
1
Silver
2
Shoes
0
will
1
carry
2
you
1
over
2
the
1
desert
2
replied
2
Glinda
2
If
1
you
1
had
1
known
1
their
1
power
2
you
1
could
1
have
1
gone
1
back
1
to
1
your
1
Aunt
1
Em
1
the
1
very
2
first
1
day
1
you
1
came
1
to
1
this
1
country
2
But
1
then
1
I
1
should
1
not
1
have
1
had
1
my
1
wonderful
3
brains
1
cried
1
the
1
Scarecrow
3
I
1
might
1
have
1
passed
1
my
1
whole
1
life
1
in
1
the
1
farmer's
2
cornfield
3
And
1
I
1
should
1
not
1
have
1
had
1
my
1
lovely
3
heart
2
said
1
the
1
Tin
1
Woodman
2
I
1
might
1
have
1
stood
1
and
1
rusted
1
in
1
the
1
forest
2
till
1
the
1
end
1
of
1
the
1
world
1
And
1
I
1
should
1
have
1
lived
1
a
1
coward
2
forever
3
declared
2
the
1
Lion
1
and
1
no
1
beast
2
in
1
all
1
the
1
forest
2
would
1
have
1
had
1
a
1
good
1
word
1
to
1
say
1
to
1
me
1
This
1
is
1
all
1
true

said

Dorothy

1
I

am

glad

I

was
1
of
1
use

to

these

good

friends

But

now

that

each

them

has

had

what

desired

each

is

happy

in

having

a

kingdom

besides

I

I

All

She

around

the

Lion

him

patting

his

in

a

way
1
most

dangerous
3
to

his

she

hugged

the

body
2
of

the

his

found

she

crying

herself

at

she

so

suddenly

that

she

over

upon
