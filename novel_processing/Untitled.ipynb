Down the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\\nit, \\'and what is the use of a book,\\' thought Alice \\'without pictures or\\nconversations?\\'\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\\nof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\\nVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \\'Oh dear!\\nOh dear! I shall be late!\\' (when she thought it over afterwards, it\\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\\nit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\\nOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\\nAlice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\\nto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\\nafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\\nwell.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\\ngoing to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\\nshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\\nshe passed; it was labelled \\'ORANGE MARMALADE\\', but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\\nshe fell past it.\\n\\n\\'Well!\\' thought Alice to herself, \\'after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\\'ll all think me at\\nhome! Why, I wouldn\\'t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\\nof the house!\\' (Which was very likely true.)\\n\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! \\'I wonder how\\nmany miles I\\'ve fallen by this time?\\' she said aloud. \\'I must be getting\\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\\nthousand miles down, I think--\\' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\\nthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\\nwas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\\nwas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\\n\\'--yes, that\\'s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\\nor Longitude I\\'ve got to?\\' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\\nLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\\n\\nPresently she began again. \\'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\\nearth! How funny it\\'ll seem to come out among the people that walk with\\ntheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\\' (she was rather glad\\nthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\\'t sound at all the\\nright word) \\'--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\\nis, you know. Please, Ma\\'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\\' (and\\nshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\\'re falling\\nthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \\'And what an\\nignorant little girl she\\'ll think me for asking! No, it\\'ll never do to\\nask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\\'\\n\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. \\'Dinah\\'ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\\'\\n(Dinah was the cat.) \\'I hope they\\'ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\\nmice in the air, I\\'m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\\'s very\\nlike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\\' And here Alice\\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\\nsort of way, \\'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\\' and sometimes, \\'Do\\nbats eat cats?\\' for, you see, as she couldn\\'t answer either question,\\nit didn\\'t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\\noff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\\nDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \\'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\\ndid you ever eat a bat?\\' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\\na heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\\nThere was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\\nwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \\'Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it\\'s getting!\\' She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\\'s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\\nthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\\ndoorway; \\'and even if my head would go through,\\' thought poor Alice, \\'it\\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\\nshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\\'\\nFor, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\\nthat Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\\nimpossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (\\'which certainly was not here\\nbefore,\\' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words \\'DRINK ME\\' beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say \\'Drink me,\\' but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do THAT in a hurry. \\'No, I\\'ll look first,\\' she said, \\'and\\nsee whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\'; for she had read several nice\\nlittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\\nbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\\nthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\\npoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\\nforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\'poison,\\' it is\\nalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was NOT marked \\'poison,\\' so Alice ventured to taste\\nit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\\nof cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\\nbuttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\'What a curious feeling!\\' said Alice; \\'I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.\\'\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; \\'for it might end, you know,\\' said\\nAlice to herself, \\'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder\\nwhat I should be like then?\\' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\\ncandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\\never having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n\\'Come, there\\'s no use in crying like that!\\' said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; \\'I advise you to leave off this minute!\\' She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n\\'But it\\'s no use now,\\' thought poor Alice, \\'to pretend to be two people!\\nWhy, there\\'s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\\'\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n\\'EAT ME\\' were beautifully marked in currants. \\'Well, I\\'ll eat it,\\' said\\nAlice, \\'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\\'ll\\nget into the garden, and I don\\'t care which happens!\\'\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \\'Which way? Which\\nway?\\', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\\nin the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears\\n\\n\\'Curiouser and curiouser!\\' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \\'now I\\'m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\\'\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). \\'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder\\nwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\\'m sure\\n_I_ shan\\'t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be\\nkind to them,\\' thought Alice, \\'or perhaps they won\\'t walk the way I want\\nto go! Let me see: I\\'ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\\'\\n\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \\'They must\\ngo by the carrier,\\' she thought; \\'and how funny it\\'ll seem, sending\\npresents to one\\'s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n\\n     ALICE\\'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\\n       HEARTHRUG,\\n         NEAR THE FENDER,\\n           (WITH ALICE\\'S LOVE).\\n\\nOh dear, what nonsense I\\'m talking!\\'\\n\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\n\\'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\\' said Alice, \\'a great girl like\\nyou,\\' (she might well say this), \\'to go on crying in this way! Stop this\\nmoment, I tell you!\\' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of\\ntears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches\\ndeep and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in\\none hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great\\nhurry, muttering to himself as he came, \\'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!\\nOh! won\\'t she be savage if I\\'ve kept her waiting!\\' Alice felt so\\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \\'If you please, sir--\\'\\nThe Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,\\nand skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \\'Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I\\'ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a\\nlittle different. But if I\\'m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, THAT\\'S the great puzzle!\\' And she began thinking\\nover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to\\nsee if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sure I\\'m not Ada,\\' she said, \\'for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn\\'t go in ringlets at all; and I\\'m sure I can\\'t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, SHE\\'S she, and I\\'m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling\\nit all is! I\\'ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me\\nsee: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and\\nfour times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!\\nHowever, the Multiplication Table doesn\\'t signify: let\\'s try Geography.\\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and\\nRome--no, THAT\\'S all wrong, I\\'m certain! I must have been changed for\\nMabel! I\\'ll try and say \"How doth the little--\"\\' and she crossed her\\nhands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,\\nbut her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the\\nsame as they used to do:--\\n\\n     \\'How doth the little crocodile\\n      Improve his shining tail,\\n     And pour the waters of the Nile\\n      On every golden scale!\\n\\n     \\'How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\n      How neatly spread his claws,\\n     And welcome little fishes in\\n      With gently smiling jaws!\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sure those are not the right words,\\' said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \\'I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\\'ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I\\'m Mabel, I\\'ll stay down here! It\\'ll be no\\nuse their putting their heads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\" I\\nshall only look up and say \"Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,\\nif I like being that person, I\\'ll come up: if not, I\\'ll stay down here\\ntill I\\'m somebody else\"--but, oh dear!\\' cried Alice, with a sudden burst\\nof tears, \\'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired\\nof being all alone here!\\'\\n\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit\\'s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. \\'How CAN I have done that?\\' she thought. \\'I must\\nbe growing small again.\\' She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\\nabout two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\\nout that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped\\nit hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n\\'That WAS a narrow escape!\\' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \\'and\\nnow for the garden!\\' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:\\nbut, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\\nlying on the glass table as before, \\'and things are worse than ever,\\'\\nthought the poor child, \\'for I never was so small as this before, never!\\nAnd I declare it\\'s too bad, that it is!\\'\\n\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\\nshe was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\\nhad somehow fallen into the sea, \\'and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,\\' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\\nmade out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\\nwas nine feet high.\\n\\n\\'I wish I hadn\\'t cried so much!\\' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. \\'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\\nHowever, everything is queer to-day.\\'\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\\n\\'Would it be of any use, now,\\' thought Alice, \\'to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there\\'s no harm in trying.\\' So she\\nbegan: \\'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\\' (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother\\'s Latin Grammar, \\'A mouse--of\\na mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\\') The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\\n\\'Perhaps it doesn\\'t understand English,\\' thought Alice; \\'I daresay it\\'s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\\' (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \\'Ou est ma chatte?\\' which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\\n\\'Oh, I beg your pardon!\\' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\\nthe poor animal\\'s feelings. \\'I quite forgot you didn\\'t like cats.\\'\\n\\n\\'Not like cats!\\' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \\'Would\\nYOU like cats if you were me?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, perhaps not,\\' said Alice in a soothing tone: \\'don\\'t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\\'d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\\nthing,\\' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\\npool, \\'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\\nwashing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she\\'s\\nsuch a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!\\' cried\\nAlice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\\nfelt certain it must be really offended. \\'We won\\'t talk about her any\\nmore if you\\'d rather not.\\'\\n\\n\\'We indeed!\\' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. \\'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\\ncats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\\'t let me hear the name again!\\'\\n\\n\\'I won\\'t indeed!\\' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. \\'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?\\' The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \\'There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\\'ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it\\'ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things--I can\\'t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\\nyou know, and he says it\\'s so useful, it\\'s worth a hundred pounds! He\\nsays it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\\' cried Alice in a sorrowful\\ntone, \\'I\\'m afraid I\\'ve offended it again!\\' For the Mouse was swimming\\naway from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\\nthe pool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, \\'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon\\'t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\\'t like them!\\' When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\\nface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, \\'Let us get to the shore, and then I\\'ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you\\'ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\\'\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\\na Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\\nway, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\\nto Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\\nknown them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\\nLory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \\'I am older than\\nyou, and must know better\\'; and this Alice would not allow without\\nknowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\\nage, there was no more to be said.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\ncalled out, \\'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\\'LL soon make you\\ndry enough!\\' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\\nin the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\\nsure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\n\\'Ahem!\\' said the Mouse with an important air, \\'are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \"William\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria--\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Ugh!\\' said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n\\'I beg your pardon!\\' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \\'Did\\nyou speak?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not I!\\' said the Lory hastily.\\n\\n\\'I thought you did,\\' said the Mouse. \\'--I proceed. \"Edwin and Morcar,\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\\nthe patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Found WHAT?\\' said the Duck.\\n\\n\\'Found IT,\\' the Mouse replied rather crossly: \\'of course you know what\\n\"it\" means.\\'\\n\\n\\'I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,\\' said the\\nDuck: \\'it\\'s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?\\'\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \\'\"--found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\\ncrown. William\\'s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\\nNormans--\" How are you getting on now, my dear?\\' it continued, turning\\nto Alice as it spoke.\\n\\n\\'As wet as ever,\\' said Alice in a melancholy tone: \\'it doesn\\'t seem to\\ndry me at all.\\'\\n\\n\\'In that case,\\' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \\'I move\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies--\\'\\n\\n\\'Speak English!\\' said the Eaglet. \\'I don\\'t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what\\'s more, I don\\'t believe you do either!\\' And\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly.\\n\\n\\'What I was going to say,\\' said the Dodo in an offended tone, \\'was, that\\nthe best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\\'\\n\\n\\'What IS a Caucus-race?\\' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\\nbut the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\\nand no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\n\\'Why,\\' said the Dodo, \\'the best way to explain it is to do it.\\' (And, as\\nyou might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\\nyou how the Dodo managed it.)\\n\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\\'the exact\\nshape doesn\\'t matter,\\' it said,) and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no \\'One, two, three, and\\naway,\\' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\\nthe Dodo suddenly called out \\'The race is over!\\' and they all crowded\\nround it, panting, and asking, \\'But who has won?\\'\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\\nand it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\\n(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\\nof him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\\n\\'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.\\'\\n\\n\\'But who is to give the prizes?\\' quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n\\'Why, SHE, of course,\\' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\\nand the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\\nway, \\'Prizes! Prizes!\\'\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\\na-piece all round.\\n\\n\\'But she must have a prize herself, you know,\\' said the Mouse.\\n\\n\\'Of course,\\' the Dodo replied very gravely. \\'What else have you got in\\nyour pocket?\\' he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\n\\'Only a thimble,\\' said Alice sadly.\\n\\n\\'Hand it over here,\\' said the Dodo.\\n\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble, saying \\'We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble\\'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\\n\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\\ncould.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n\\'You promised to tell me your history, you know,\\' said Alice, \\'and why\\nit is you hate--C and D,\\' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n\\'Mine is a long and a sad tale!\\' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\nsighing.\\n\\n\\'It IS a long tail, certainly,\\' said Alice, looking down with wonder at\\nthe Mouse\\'s tail; \\'but why do you call it sad?\\' And she kept on puzzling\\nabout it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\\nsomething like this:--\\n\\n         \\'Fury said to a\\n         mouse, That he\\n        met in the\\n       house,\\n     \"Let us\\n      both go to\\n       law: I will\\n        prosecute\\n         YOU.--Come,\\n           I\\'ll take no\\n           denial; We\\n          must have a\\n        trial: For\\n      really this\\n     morning I\\'ve\\n    nothing\\n    to do.\"\\n     Said the\\n      mouse to the\\n       cur, \"Such\\n        a trial,\\n         dear Sir,\\n            With\\n          no jury\\n        or judge,\\n       would be\\n      wasting\\n      our\\n      breath.\"\\n       \"I\\'ll be\\n        judge, I\\'ll\\n         be jury,\"\\n            Said\\n         cunning\\n          old Fury:\\n          \"I\\'ll\\n          try the\\n            whole\\n            cause,\\n              and\\n           condemn\\n           you\\n          to\\n           death.\"\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'You are not attending!\\' said the Mouse to Alice severely. \\'What are you\\nthinking of?\\'\\n\\n\\'I beg your pardon,\\' said Alice very humbly: \\'you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?\\'\\n\\n\\'I had NOT!\\' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\n\\'A knot!\\' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\nanxiously about her. \\'Oh, do let me help to undo it!\\'\\n\\n\\'I shall do nothing of the sort,\\' said the Mouse, getting up and walking\\naway. \\'You insult me by talking such nonsense!\\'\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t mean it!\\' pleaded poor Alice. \\'But you\\'re so easily offended,\\nyou know!\\'\\n\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\n\\'Please come back and finish your story!\\' Alice called after it; and the\\nothers all joined in chorus, \\'Yes, please do!\\' but the Mouse only shook\\nits head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n\\'What a pity it wouldn\\'t stay!\\' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite\\nout of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her\\ndaughter \\'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\nYOUR temper!\\' \\'Hold your tongue, Ma!\\' said the young Crab, a little\\nsnappishly. \\'You\\'re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\\'\\n\\n\\'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\\' said Alice aloud, addressing\\nnobody in particular. \\'She\\'d soon fetch it back!\\'\\n\\n\\'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\\' said the\\nLory.\\n\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\n\\'Dinah\\'s our cat. And she\\'s such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncan\\'t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\nshe\\'ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\\'\\n\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully, remarking, \\'I really must be getting home; the night-air\\ndoesn\\'t suit my throat!\\' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to\\nits children, \\'Come away, my dears! It\\'s high time you were all in bed!\\'\\nOn various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\\n\\n\\'I wish I hadn\\'t mentioned Dinah!\\' she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone. \\'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\\'m sure she\\'s the best\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\nany more!\\' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard\\na little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming\\nback to finish his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\nit muttering to itself \\'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\nmy fur and whiskers! She\\'ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\\' Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\\nand she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\\nnowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\\nthe pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\\nhad vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, \\'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\\nout here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\\nQuick, now!\\' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\\nin the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\\nhad made.\\n\\n\\'He took me for his housemaid,\\' she said to herself as she ran. \\'How\\nsurprised he\\'ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\\'d better take him\\nhis fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\\' As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name \\'W. RABBIT\\' engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\n\\'How queer it seems,\\' Alice said to herself, \\'to be going messages for\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah\\'ll be sending me on messages next!\\' And she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \\'\"Miss Alice! Come\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute,\\nnurse! But I\\'ve got to see that the mouse doesn\\'t get out.\" Only I don\\'t\\nthink,\\' Alice went on, \\'that they\\'d let Dinah stop in the house if it\\nbegan ordering people about like that!\\'\\n\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\\nof tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\\nand was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\\nbottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\\nwith the words \\'DRINK ME,\\' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\\nto her lips. \\'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\\' she said\\nto herself, \\'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\\'ll just see what\\nthis bottle does. I do hope it\\'ll make me grow large again, for really\\nI\\'m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\\'\\n\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself \\'That\\'s quite enough--I hope I shan\\'t\\ngrow any more--As it is, I can\\'t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn\\'t\\ndrunk quite so much!\\'\\n\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \\'Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?\\'\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\n\\'It was much pleasanter at home,\\' thought poor Alice, \\'when one wasn\\'t\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn\\'t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\\nyet--it\\'s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\nCAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\\nkind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\\nThere ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\\ngrow up, I\\'ll write one--but I\\'m grown up now,\\' she added in a sorrowful\\ntone; \\'at least there\\'s no room to grow up any more HERE.\\'\\n\\n\\'But then,\\' thought Alice, \\'shall I NEVER get any older than I am\\nnow? That\\'ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\\nthen--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\\'t like THAT!\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, you foolish Alice!\\' she answered herself. \\'How can you learn\\nlessons in here? Why, there\\'s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\\nfor any lesson-books!\\'\\n\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\\nquite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\\na voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n\\'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\\' said the voice. \\'Fetch me my gloves this moment!\\'\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\\nas the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice\\'s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \\'Then I\\'ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.\\'\\n\\n\\'THAT you won\\'t\\' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice--the Rabbit\\'s--\\'Pat! Pat! Where are you?\\' And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \\'Sure then I\\'m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!\\'\\n\\n\\'Digging for apples, indeed!\\' said the Rabbit angrily. \\'Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of THIS!\\' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\\n\\'Now tell me, Pat, what\\'s that in the window?\\'\\n\\n\\'Sure, it\\'s an arm, yer honour!\\' (He pronounced it \\'arrum.\\')\\n\\n\\'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\nwindow!\\'\\n\\n\\'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\\'s an arm for all that.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, it\\'s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\\'\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then; such as, \\'Sure, I don\\'t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\nall!\\' \\'Do as I tell you, you coward!\\' and at last she spread out her\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\nTWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \\'What a number of\\ncucumber-frames there must be!\\' thought Alice. \\'I wonder what they\\'ll do\\nnext! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\\'m\\nsure I don\\'t want to stay in here any longer!\\'\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\\nall talking together: she made out the words: \\'Where\\'s the other\\nladder?--Why, I hadn\\'t to bring but one; Bill\\'s got the other--Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!--Here, put \\'em up at this corner--No, tie \\'em\\ntogether first--they don\\'t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they\\'ll\\ndo well enough; don\\'t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\nrope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it\\'s coming\\ndown! Heads below!\\' (a loud crash)--\\'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\\nfancy--Who\\'s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan\\'t! YOU do it!--That I\\nwon\\'t, then!--Bill\\'s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you\\'re to\\ngo down the chimney!\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh! So Bill\\'s got to come down the chimney, has he?\\' said Alice to\\nherself. \\'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\\'t be in\\nBill\\'s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\nI THINK I can kick a little!\\'\\n\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\\ntill she heard a little animal (she couldn\\'t guess of what sort it was)\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\nsaying to herself \\'This is Bill,\\' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\\nsee what would happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \\'There goes Bill!\\'\\nthen the Rabbit\\'s voice along--\\'Catch him, you by the hedge!\\' then\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices--\\'Hold up his head--Brandy\\nnow--Don\\'t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\nus all about it!\\'\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\\'That\\'s Bill,\\' thought\\nAlice,) \\'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I\\'m better now--but I\\'m\\na deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\\'\\n\\n\\'So you did, old fellow!\\' said the others.\\n\\n\\'We must burn the house down!\\' said the Rabbit\\'s voice; and Alice called\\nout as loud as she could, \\'If you do. I\\'ll set Dinah at you!\\'\\n\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \\'I\\nwonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they\\'d take the\\nroof off.\\' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, \\'A barrowful will do, to begin with.\\'\\n\\n\\'A barrowful of WHAT?\\' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. \\'I\\'ll put a stop to this,\\'\\nshe said to herself, and shouted out, \\'You\\'d better not do that again!\\'\\nwhich produced another dead silence.\\n\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\nhead. \\'If I eat one of these cakes,\\' she thought, \\'it\\'s sure to make\\nSOME change in my size; and as it can\\'t possibly make me larger, it must\\nmake me smaller, I suppose.\\'\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\\nthe door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\\nanimals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\\nin the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\n\\n\\'The first thing I\\'ve got to do,\\' said Alice to herself, as she wandered\\nabout in the wood, \\'is to grow to my right size again; and the second\\nthing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\\nthe best plan.\\'\\n\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.\\n\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \\'Poor little thing!\\'\\nsaid Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\\nshe was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\\nhungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\\nall her coaxing.\\n\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\n\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\\ntill the puppy\\'s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\n\\'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\\' said Alice, as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves: \\'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I\\'d\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\\'d nearly forgotten that\\nI\\'ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\nquestion is, what?\\'\\n\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it.\\n\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\\nthat was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\\nhookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar\\n\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:\\nat last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\\nher in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n\\'Who are YOU?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, \\'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\\nwho I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.\\'\\n\\n\\'What do you mean by that?\\' said the Caterpillar sternly. \\'Explain\\nyourself!\\'\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t explain MYSELF, I\\'m afraid, sir\\' said Alice, \\'because I\\'m not\\nmyself, you see.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t see,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m afraid I can\\'t put it more clearly,\\' Alice replied very politely,\\n\\'for I can\\'t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\\'\\n\\n\\'It isn\\'t,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'Well, perhaps you haven\\'t found it so yet,\\' said Alice; \\'but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you\\'ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won\\'t you?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not a bit,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\\' said Alice; \\'all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to ME.\\'\\n\\n\\'You!\\' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \\'Who are YOU?\\'\\n\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\\'s making such VERY\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \\'I think,\\nyou ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n\\'Come back!\\' the Caterpillar called after her. \\'I\\'ve something important\\nto say!\\'\\n\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n\\'Keep your temper,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'Is that all?\\' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\\nperhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\\nminutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\\narms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \\'So you think\\nyou\\'re changed, do you?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m afraid I am, sir,\\' said Alice; \\'I can\\'t remember things as I\\nused--and I don\\'t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\\'\\n\\n\\'Can\\'t remember WHAT things?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'Well, I\\'ve tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it all came\\ndifferent!\\' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\n\\'Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:--\\n\\n   \\'You are old, Father William,\\' the young man said,\\n    \\'And your hair has become very white;\\n   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?\\'\\n\\n   \\'In my youth,\\' Father William replied to his son,\\n    \\'I feared it might injure the brain;\\n   But, now that I\\'m perfectly sure I have none,\\n    Why, I do it again and again.\\'\\n\\n   \\'You are old,\\' said the youth, \\'as I mentioned before,\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\n   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?\\'\\n\\n   \\'In my youth,\\' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n    \\'I kept all my limbs very supple\\n   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?\\'\\n\\n   \\'You are old,\\' said the youth, \\'and your jaws are too weak\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\n   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\\n    Pray how did you manage to do it?\\'\\n\\n   \\'In my youth,\\' said his father, \\'I took to the law,\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\n   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.\\'\\n\\n   \\'You are old,\\' said the youth, \\'one would hardly suppose\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\n   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\\n    What made you so awfully clever?\\'\\n\\n   \\'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\\'\\n    Said his father; \\'don\\'t give yourself airs!\\n   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\n    Be off, or I\\'ll kick you down stairs!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'That is not said right,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'Not QUITE right, I\\'m afraid,\\' said Alice, timidly; \\'some of the words\\nhave got altered.\\'\\n\\n\\'It is wrong from beginning to end,\\' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and\\nthere was silence for some minutes.\\n\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\'What size do you want to be?\\' it asked.\\n\\n\\'Oh, I\\'m not particular as to size,\\' Alice hastily replied; \\'only one\\ndoesn\\'t like changing so often, you know.\\'\\n\\n\\'I DON\\'T know,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\n\\'Are you content now?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn\\'t mind,\\'\\nsaid Alice: \\'three inches is such a wretched height to be.\\'\\n\\n\\'It is a very good height indeed!\\' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing\\nitself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\n\\'But I\\'m not used to it!\\' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\\nshe thought of herself, \\'I wish the creatures wouldn\\'t be so easily\\noffended!\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'ll get used to it in time,\\' said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\n\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In\\na minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\\nand yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n\\'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.\\'\\n\\n\\'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?\\' thought Alice to herself.\\n\\n\\'Of the mushroom,\\' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\\nto make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\\nround, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\\nstretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\\nof the edge with each hand.\\n\\n\\'And now which is which?\\' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\\nblow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\'Come, my head\\'s free at last!\\' said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n\\'What CAN all that green stuff be?\\' said Alice. \\'And where HAVE my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\\'t see you?\\'\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\n\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\\ntried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\\nneck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\\njust succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\\nto dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\\nof the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\\nher draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\\nwas beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\n\\'Serpent!\\' screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m NOT a serpent!\\' said Alice indignantly. \\'Let me alone!\\'\\n\\n\\'Serpent, I say again!\\' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\\nand added with a kind of sob, \\'I\\'ve tried every way, and nothing seems\\nto suit them!\\'\\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t the least idea what you\\'re talking about,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve tried the roots of trees, and I\\'ve tried banks, and I\\'ve tried\\nhedges,\\' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \\'but those\\nserpents! There\\'s no pleasing them!\\'\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\n\\'As if it wasn\\'t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\\' said the Pigeon;\\n\\'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven\\'t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m very sorry you\\'ve been annoyed,\\' said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\\n\\'And just as I\\'d taken the highest tree in the wood,\\' continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \\'and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from\\nthe sky! Ugh, Serpent!\\'\\n\\n\\'But I\\'m NOT a serpent, I tell you!\\' said Alice. \\'I\\'m a--I\\'m a--\\'\\n\\n\\'Well! WHAT are you?\\' said the Pigeon. \\'I can see you\\'re trying to\\ninvent something!\\'\\n\\n\\'I--I\\'m a little girl,\\' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n\\'A likely story indeed!\\' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. \\'I\\'ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\\nwith such a neck as that! No, no! You\\'re a serpent; and there\\'s no use\\ndenying it. I suppose you\\'ll be telling me next that you never tasted an\\negg!\\'\\n\\n\\'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,\\' said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; \\'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t believe it,\\' said the Pigeon; \\'but if they do, why then they\\'re\\na kind of serpent, that\\'s all I can say.\\'\\n\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \\'You\\'re\\nlooking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\\nwhether you\\'re a little girl or a serpent?\\'\\n\\n\\'It matters a good deal to ME,\\' said Alice hastily; \\'but I\\'m not looking\\nfor eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\\'t want YOURS: I don\\'t\\nlike them raw.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, be off, then!\\' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\\nshe could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\\nevery now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\\nremembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\\nshe set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\\nsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \\'Come, there\\'s half my plan done\\nnow! How puzzling all these changes are! I\\'m never sure what I\\'m going\\nto be, from one minute to another! However, I\\'ve got back to my right\\nsize: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\\nto be done, I wonder?\\' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\\nplace, with a little house in it about four feet high. \\'Whoever lives\\nthere,\\' thought Alice, \\'it\\'ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\\nI should frighten them out of their wits!\\' So she began nibbling at the\\nrighthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\\nhad brought herself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\nfish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\\nby another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\\nover their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\\nand crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \\'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\\nto play croquet.\\' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\\nonly changing the order of the words a little, \\'From the Queen. An\\ninvitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\\'\\n\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\\nwood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s no sort of use in knocking,\\' said the Footman, \\'and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I\\'m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they\\'re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.\\' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\\ngoing on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\\na great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\\n\\n\\'Please, then,\\' said Alice, \\'how am I to get in?\\'\\n\\n\\'There might be some sense in your knocking,\\' the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, \\'if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\\'\\nHe was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\\nAlice thought decidedly uncivil. \\'But perhaps he can\\'t help it,\\' she\\nsaid to herself; \\'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\\nBut at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?\\' she\\nrepeated, aloud.\\n\\n\\'I shall sit here,\\' the Footman remarked, \\'till tomorrow--\\'\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman\\'s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\n\\'--or next day, maybe,\\' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\\n\\'How am I to get in?\\' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n\\'ARE you to get in at all?\\' said the Footman. \\'That\\'s the first\\nquestion, you know.\\'\\n\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \\'It\\'s really\\ndreadful,\\' she muttered to herself, \\'the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt\\'s enough to drive one crazy!\\'\\n\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. \\'I shall sit here,\\' he said, \\'on and off, for\\ndays and days.\\'\\n\\n\\'But what am I to do?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Anything you like,\\' said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n\\'Oh, there\\'s no use in talking to him,\\' said Alice desperately: \\'he\\'s\\nperfectly idiotic!\\' And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\\nthe middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\\na large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\\' Alice said to herself,\\nas well as she could for sneezing.\\n\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\\nsneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment\\'s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\\nthe hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n\\'Please would you tell me,\\' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \\'why\\nyour cat grins like that?\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a Cheshire cat,\\' said the Duchess, \\'and that\\'s why. Pig!\\'\\n\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\\nand not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\\'t know\\nthat cats COULD grin.\\'\\n\\n\\'They all can,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and most of \\'em do.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know of any that do,\\' Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t know much,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and that\\'s a fact.\\'\\n\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n\\'Oh, PLEASE mind what you\\'re doing!\\' cried Alice, jumping up and down in\\nan agony of terror. \\'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose\\'; as an unusually\\nlarge saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\\n\\n\\'If everybody minded their own business,\\' the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, \\'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\\'\\n\\n\\'Which would NOT be an advantage,\\' said Alice, who felt very glad to get\\nan opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \\'Just think of\\nwhat work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\\ntwenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--\\'\\n\\n\\'Talking of axes,\\' said the Duchess, \\'chop off her head!\\'\\n\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: \\'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\\nit twelve? I--\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, don\\'t bother ME,\\' said the Duchess; \\'I never could abide figures!\\'\\nAnd with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\\nlullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\\nevery line:\\n\\n   \\'Speak roughly to your little boy,\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\n   He only does it to annoy,\\n    Because he knows it teases.\\'\\n\\n         CHORUS.\\n\\n (In which the cook and the baby joined):--\\n\\n       \\'Wow! wow! wow!\\'\\n\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:--\\n\\n   \\'I speak severely to my boy,\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\n   For he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    The pepper when he pleases!\\'\\n\\n         CHORUS.\\n\\n       \\'Wow! wow! wow!\\'\\n\\n\\'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\\' the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \\'I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,\\' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw\\na frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \\'just\\nlike a star-fish,\\' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting\\nlike a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and\\nstraightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute\\nor two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\n\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\\nit out into the open air. \\'IF I don\\'t take this child away with me,\\'\\nthought Alice, \\'they\\'re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\\'t it be\\nmurder to leave it behind?\\' She said the last words out loud, and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n\\'Don\\'t grunt,\\' said Alice; \\'that\\'s not at all a proper way of expressing\\nyourself.\\'\\n\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\\nsee what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\na VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\\neyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\\nlike the look of the thing at all. \\'But perhaps it was only sobbing,\\'\\nshe thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\\ntears.\\n\\nNo, there were no tears. \\'If you\\'re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\\'\\nsaid Alice, seriously, \\'I\\'ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\nnow!\\' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \\'Now, what am I to do with\\nthis creature when I get it home?\\' when it grunted again, so violently,\\nthat she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\\nbe NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\\nfelt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\\n\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\\nit trot away quietly into the wood. \\'If it had grown up,\\' she said\\nto herself, \\'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\\' And she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\nto herself, \\'if one only knew the right way to change them--\\' when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\\ntree a few yards off.\\n\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\nthought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\n\\'Cheshire Puss,\\' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\\n\\'Come, it\\'s pleased so far,\\' thought Alice, and she went on. \\'Would you\\ntell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\\'\\n\\n\\'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\\' said the Cat.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t much care where--\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Then it doesn\\'t matter which way you go,\\' said the Cat.\\n\\n\\'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\\' Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\n\\'Oh, you\\'re sure to do that,\\' said the Cat, \\'if you only walk long\\nenough.\\'\\n\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\\n\\'What sort of people live about here?\\'\\n\\n\\'In THAT direction,\\' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \\'lives\\na Hatter: and in THAT direction,\\' waving the other paw, \\'lives a March\\nHare. Visit either you like: they\\'re both mad.\\'\\n\\n\\'But I don\\'t want to go among mad people,\\' Alice remarked.\\n\\n\\'Oh, you can\\'t help that,\\' said the Cat: \\'we\\'re all mad here. I\\'m mad.\\nYou\\'re mad.\\'\\n\\n\\'How do you know I\\'m mad?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'You must be,\\' said the Cat, \\'or you wouldn\\'t have come here.\\'\\n\\nAlice didn\\'t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \\'And how\\ndo you know that you\\'re mad?\\'\\n\\n\\'To begin with,\\' said the Cat, \\'a dog\\'s not mad. You grant that?\\'\\n\\n\\'I suppose so,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Well, then,\\' the Cat went on, \\'you see, a dog growls when it\\'s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it\\'s pleased. Now I growl when I\\'m pleased, and\\nwag my tail when I\\'m angry. Therefore I\\'m mad.\\'\\n\\n\\'I call it purring, not growling,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Call it what you like,\\' said the Cat. \\'Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?\\'\\n\\n\\'I should like it very much,\\' said Alice, \\'but I haven\\'t been invited\\nyet.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'ll see me there,\\' said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\n\\n\\'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\' said the Cat. \\'I\\'d nearly\\nforgotten to ask.\\'\\n\\n\\'It turned into a pig,\\' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way.\\n\\n\\'I thought it would,\\' said the Cat, and vanished again.\\n\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \\'I\\'ve seen hatters before,\\' she\\nsaid to herself; \\'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\nperhaps as this is May it won\\'t be raving mad--at least not so mad as\\nit was in March.\\' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\n\\'Did you say pig, or fig?\\' said the Cat.\\n\\n\\'I said pig,\\' replied Alice; \\'and I wish you wouldn\\'t keep appearing and\\nvanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\\'\\n\\n\\'All right,\\' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\n\\'Well! I\\'ve often seen a cat without a grin,\\' thought Alice; \\'but a grin\\nwithout a cat! It\\'s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\\'\\n\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\\nof the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\\nabout two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\\nsaying to herself \\'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\\nwish I\\'d gone to see the Hatter instead!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \\'Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\\' thought Alice; \\'only, as it\\'s asleep, I\\nsuppose it doesn\\'t mind.\\'\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: \\'No room! No room!\\' they cried out when they saw Alice\\ncoming. \\'There\\'s PLENTY of room!\\' said Alice indignantly, and she sat\\ndown in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\n\\'Have some wine,\\' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\n\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n\\'I don\\'t see any wine,\\' she remarked.\\n\\n\\'There isn\\'t any,\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\'Then it wasn\\'t very civil of you to offer it,\\' said Alice angrily.\\n\\n\\'It wasn\\'t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\\' said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t know it was YOUR table,\\' said Alice; \\'it\\'s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.\\'\\n\\n\\'Your hair wants cutting,\\' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\\nfor some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\\n\\n\\'You should learn not to make personal remarks,\\' Alice said with some\\nseverity; \\'it\\'s very rude.\\'\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\\nwas, \\'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\\'\\n\\n\\'Come, we shall have some fun now!\\' thought Alice. \\'I\\'m glad they\\'ve\\nbegun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,\\' she added aloud.\\n\\n\\'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\\' said the\\nMarch Hare.\\n\\n\\'Exactly so,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Then you should say what you mean,\\' the March Hare went on.\\n\\n\\'I do,\\' Alice hastily replied; \\'at least--at least I mean what I\\nsay--that\\'s the same thing, you know.\\'\\n\\n\\'Not the same thing a bit!\\' said the Hatter. \\'You might just as well say\\nthat \"I see what I eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!\\'\\n\\n\\'You might just as well say,\\' added the March Hare, \\'that \"I like what I\\nget\" is the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!\\'\\n\\n\\'You might just as well say,\\' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, \\'that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing\\nas \"I sleep when I breathe\"!\\'\\n\\n\\'It IS the same thing with you,\\' said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\\nthought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\\nwhich wasn\\'t much.\\n\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \\'What day of the month\\nis it?\\' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\n\\nAlice considered a little, and then said \\'The fourth.\\'\\n\\n\\'Two days wrong!\\' sighed the Hatter. \\'I told you butter wouldn\\'t suit\\nthe works!\\' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\n\\'It was the BEST butter,\\' the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\n\\'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\\' the Hatter grumbled:\\n\\'you shouldn\\'t have put it in with the bread-knife.\\'\\n\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \\'It was the BEST butter,\\nyou know.\\'\\n\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \\'What a\\nfunny watch!\\' she remarked. \\'It tells the day of the month, and doesn\\'t\\ntell what o\\'clock it is!\\'\\n\\n\\'Why should it?\\' muttered the Hatter. \\'Does YOUR watch tell you what\\nyear it is?\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course not,\\' Alice replied very readily: \\'but that\\'s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\\'\\n\\n\\'Which is just the case with MINE,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\\'s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \\'I don\\'t quite\\nunderstand you,\\' she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\n\\'The Dormouse is asleep again,\\' said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\n\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, \\'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\\'\\n\\n\\'Have you guessed the riddle yet?\\' the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n\\'No, I give it up,\\' Alice replied: \\'what\\'s the answer?\\'\\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t the slightest idea,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\'Nor I,\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice sighed wearily. \\'I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,\\' she said, \\'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\\'\\n\\n\\'If you knew Time as well as I do,\\' said the Hatter, \\'you wouldn\\'t talk\\nabout wasting IT. It\\'s HIM.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what you mean,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Of course you don\\'t!\\' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\\n\\'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\\'\\n\\n\\'Perhaps not,\\' Alice cautiously replied: \\'but I know I have to beat time\\nwhen I learn music.\\'\\n\\n\\'Ah! that accounts for it,\\' said the Hatter. \\'He won\\'t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\\'d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you\\'d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!\\'\\n\\n(\\'I only wish it was,\\' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\\n\\'That would be grand, certainly,\\' said Alice thoughtfully: \\'but then--I\\nshouldn\\'t be hungry for it, you know.\\'\\n\\n\\'Not at first, perhaps,\\' said the Hatter: \\'but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\\'\\n\\n\\'Is that the way YOU manage?\\' Alice asked.\\n\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \\'Not I!\\' he replied. \\'We\\nquarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\\' (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \\'--it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\n     \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\n     How I wonder what you\\'re at!\"\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve heard something like it,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'It goes on, you know,\\' the Hatter continued, \\'in this way:--\\n\\n     \"Up above the world you fly,\\n     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\\n         Twinkle, twinkle--\"\\'\\n\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \\'Twinkle,\\ntwinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\\' and went on so long that they had to pinch\\nit to make it stop.\\n\\n\\'Well, I\\'d hardly finished the first verse,\\' said the Hatter, \\'when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \"He\\'s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!\"\\'\\n\\n\\'How dreadfully savage!\\' exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n\\'And ever since that,\\' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \\'he won\\'t\\ndo a thing I ask! It\\'s always six o\\'clock now.\\'\\n\\nA bright idea came into Alice\\'s head. \\'Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?\\' she asked.\\n\\n\\'Yes, that\\'s it,\\' said the Hatter with a sigh: \\'it\\'s always tea-time,\\nand we\\'ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\\'\\n\\n\\'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Exactly so,\\' said the Hatter: \\'as the things get used up.\\'\\n\\n\\'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\\' Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\\n\\'Suppose we change the subject,\\' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n\\'I\\'m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know one,\\' said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\\n\\'Then the Dormouse shall!\\' they both cried. \\'Wake up, Dormouse!\\' And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\n\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \\'I wasn\\'t asleep,\\' he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: \\'I heard every word you fellows were saying.\\'\\n\\n\\'Tell us a story!\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\'Yes, please do!\\' pleaded Alice.\\n\\n\\'And be quick about it,\\' added the Hatter, \\'or you\\'ll be asleep again\\nbefore it\\'s done.\\'\\n\\n\\'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\\' the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; \\'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well--\\'\\n\\n\\'What did they live on?\\' said Alice, who always took a great interest in\\nquestions of eating and drinking.\\n\\n\\'They lived on treacle,\\' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n\\'They couldn\\'t have done that, you know,\\' Alice gently remarked; \\'they\\'d\\nhave been ill.\\'\\n\\n\\'So they were,\\' said the Dormouse; \\'VERY ill.\\'\\n\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \\'But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\\'\\n\\n\\'Take some more tea,\\' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve had nothing yet,\\' Alice replied in an offended tone, \\'so I can\\'t\\ntake more.\\'\\n\\n\\'You mean you can\\'t take LESS,\\' said the Hatter: \\'it\\'s very easy to take\\nMORE than nothing.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Who\\'s making personal remarks now?\\' the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\n\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\\nto some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. \\'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\\'\\n\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, \\'It was a treacle-well.\\'\\n\\n\\'There\\'s no such thing!\\' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went \\'Sh! sh!\\' and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, \\'If you can\\'t be civil, you\\'d better finish the story for\\nyourself.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, please go on!\\' Alice said very humbly; \\'I won\\'t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be ONE.\\'\\n\\n\\'One, indeed!\\' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. \\'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\\nyou know--\\'\\n\\n\\'What did they draw?\\' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\n\\'Treacle,\\' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\n\\'I want a clean cup,\\' interrupted the Hatter: \\'let\\'s all move one place\\non.\\'\\n\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse\\'s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\\nthe place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\n\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: \\'But I don\\'t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?\\'\\n\\n\\'You can draw water out of a water-well,\\' said the Hatter; \\'so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\\'\\n\\n\\'But they were IN the well,\\' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\\nnotice this last remark.\\n\\n\\'Of course they were\\', said the Dormouse; \\'--well in.\\'\\n\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\\n\\'They were learning to draw,\\' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \\'and they drew all manner of\\nthings--everything that begins with an M--\\'\\n\\n\\'Why with an M?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Why not?\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice was silent.\\n\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\\na doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\\na little shriek, and went on: \\'--that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?\\'\\n\\n\\'Really, now you ask me,\\' said Alice, very much confused, \\'I don\\'t\\nthink--\\'\\n\\n\\'Then you shouldn\\'t talk,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\\n\\'At any rate I\\'ll never go THERE again!\\' said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. \\'It\\'s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\\nmy life!\\'\\n\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. \\'That\\'s very curious!\\' she thought. \\'But\\neverything\\'s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\\' And in\\nshe went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\nglass table. \\'Now, I\\'ll manage better this time,\\' she said to herself,\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\\nthen she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at\\nlast in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\\nfountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. The Queen\\'s Croquet-Ground\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went\\nnearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of\\nthem say, \\'Look out now, Five! Don\\'t go splashing paint over me like\\nthat!\\'\\n\\n\\'I couldn\\'t help it,\\' said Five, in a sulky tone; \\'Seven jogged my\\nelbow.\\'\\n\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \\'That\\'s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!\\'\\n\\n\\'YOU\\'D better not talk!\\' said Five. \\'I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\\'\\n\\n\\'What for?\\' said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s none of YOUR business, Two!\\' said Seven.\\n\\n\\'Yes, it IS his business!\\' said Five, \\'and I\\'ll tell him--it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\\'\\n\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \\'Well, of all the unjust\\nthings--\\' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and\\nall of them bowed low.\\n\\n\\'Would you tell me,\\' said Alice, a little timidly, \\'why you are painting\\nthose roses?\\'\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, \\'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\nRED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\\nSo you see, Miss, we\\'re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\\' At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout \\'The Queen! The Queen!\\' and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\\nthe three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\\nwith hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\\nthem Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\\nnervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\\nnoticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\\'s\\ncrown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\\nprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; \\'and besides, what would be the use of\\na procession,\\' thought she, \\'if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn\\'t see it?\\' So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely \\'Who is this?\\' She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n\\'Idiot!\\' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, \\'What\\'s your name, child?\\'\\n\\n\\'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\\' said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, \\'Why, they\\'re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn\\'t be afraid of them!\\'\\n\\n\\'And who are THESE?\\' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\\nwere lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\\nfaces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\\npack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or\\ncourtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\n\\'How should I know?\\' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \\'It\\'s no\\nbusiness of MINE.\\'\\n\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \\'Off with her head! Off--\\'\\n\\n\\'Nonsense!\\' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\n\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \\'Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!\\'\\n\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \\'Turn them\\nover!\\'\\n\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\n\\'Get up!\\' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\n\\'Leave off that!\\' screamed the Queen. \\'You make me giddy.\\' And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \\'What HAVE you been doing here?\\'\\n\\n\\'May it please your Majesty,\\' said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \\'we were trying--\\'\\n\\n\\'I see!\\' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n\\'Off with their heads!\\' and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\\n\\'You shan\\'t be beheaded!\\' said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\\n\\'Are their heads off?\\' shouted the Queen.\\n\\n\\'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\\' the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s right!\\' shouted the Queen. \\'Can you play croquet?\\'\\n\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' shouted Alice.\\n\\n\\'Come on, then!\\' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s--it\\'s a very fine day!\\' said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n\\'Very,\\' said Alice: \\'--where\\'s the Duchess?\\'\\n\\n\\'Hush! Hush!\\' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \\'She\\'s under\\nsentence of execution.\\'\\n\\n\\'What for?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?\\' the Rabbit asked.\\n\\n\\'No, I didn\\'t,\\' said Alice: \\'I don\\'t think it\\'s at all a pity. I said\\n\"What for?\"\\'\\n\\n\\'She boxed the Queen\\'s ears--\\' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. \\'Oh, hush!\\' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. \\'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said--\\'\\n\\n\\'Get to your places!\\' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\\nher life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\\nthe mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\\nup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\\nher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\\nits neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\\nblow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\\nwith such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\\nlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\\nagain, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\\nitself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\\ngenerally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\\nhedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\\nand walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\n\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\\ntime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting \\'Off with his head!\\' or \\'Off with her head!\\' about once in a\\nminute.\\n\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n\\'and then,\\' thought she, \\'what would become of me? They\\'re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\\'s any one\\nleft alive!\\'\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\\nin the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\\na minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\\n\\'It\\'s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\\'\\n\\n\\'How are you getting on?\\' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\n\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \\'It\\'s no use\\nspeaking to it,\\' she thought, \\'till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.\\' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\\nenough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think they play at all fairly,\\' Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, \\'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\\'t hear\\noneself speak--and they don\\'t seem to have any rules in particular;\\nat least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\\'ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\\'s the\\narch I\\'ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\\'s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\\'\\n\\n\\'How do you like the Queen?\\' said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n\\'Not at all,\\' said Alice: \\'she\\'s so extremely--\\' Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n\\'--likely to win, that it\\'s hardly worth while finishing the game.\\'\\n\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\n\\'Who ARE you talking to?\\' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\\nat the Cat\\'s head with great curiosity.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\\' said Alice: \\'allow me to\\nintroduce it.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like the look of it at all,\\' said the King: \\'however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'d rather not,\\' the Cat remarked.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be impertinent,\\' said the King, \\'and don\\'t look at me like that!\\'\\nHe got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\n\\'A cat may look at a king,\\' said Alice. \\'I\\'ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don\\'t remember where.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, it must be removed,\\' said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \\'My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!\\'\\n\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\\n\\'Off with his head!\\' she said, without even looking round.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll fetch the executioner myself,\\' said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen\\'s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\n\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\\nother side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\\nsort of way to fly up into a tree.\\n\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \\'but it doesn\\'t\\nmatter much,\\' thought Alice, \\'as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.\\' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\\nlarge crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\n\\nThe executioner\\'s argument was, that you couldn\\'t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn\\'t going to begin at HIS time of life.\\n\\nThe King\\'s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren\\'t to talk nonsense.\\n\\nThe Queen\\'s argument was, that if something wasn\\'t done about it in less\\nthan no time she\\'d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\\nremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\\n\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \\'It belongs to the Duchess:\\nyou\\'d better ask HER about it.\\'\\n\\n\\'She\\'s in prison,\\' the Queen said to the executioner: \\'fetch her here.\\'\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\n\\n The Cat\\'s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\\nby the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\\ndisappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down\\nlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle\\'s Story\\n\\n\\'You can\\'t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\\'\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\\'s, and\\nthey walked off together.\\n\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\n\\'When I\\'M a Duchess,\\' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone\\nthough), \\'I won\\'t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very\\nwell without--Maybe it\\'s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\\'\\nshe went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\\nrule, \\'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes\\nthem bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\\'t be so\\nstingy about it, you know--\\'\\n\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \\'You\\'re thinking\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\\'t\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\na bit.\\'\\n\\n\\'Perhaps it hasn\\'t one,\\' Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\n\\'Tut, tut, child!\\' said the Duchess. \\'Everything\\'s got a moral, if only\\nyou can find it.\\' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\\'s side as\\nshe spoke.\\n\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\nDuchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice\\'s shoulder, and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\nbore it as well as she could.\\n\\n\\'The game\\'s going on rather better now,\\' she said, by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little.\\n\\n\\'\\'Tis so,\\' said the Duchess: \\'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, \\'tis love,\\n\\'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Somebody said,\\' Alice whispered, \\'that it\\'s done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business!\\'\\n\\n\\'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\\' said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice\\'s shoulder as she added, \\'and the moral\\nof THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.\"\\'\\n\\n\\'How fond she is of finding morals in things!\\' Alice thought to herself.\\n\\n\\'I dare say you\\'re wondering why I don\\'t put my arm round your waist,\\'\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: \\'the reason is, that I\\'m doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\\'\\n\\n\\'HE might bite,\\' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\\nhave the experiment tried.\\n\\n\\'Very true,\\' said the Duchess: \\'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\nthe moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Only mustard isn\\'t a bird,\\' Alice remarked.\\n\\n\\'Right, as usual,\\' said the Duchess: \\'what a clear way you have of\\nputting things!\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a mineral, I THINK,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Of course it is,\\' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that Alice said; \\'there\\'s a large mustard-mine near here. And\\nthe moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\\nyours.\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I know!\\' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\\n\\'it\\'s a vegetable. It doesn\\'t look like one, but it is.\\'\\n\\n\\'I quite agree with you,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and the moral of that\\nis--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you\\'d like it put more\\nsimply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\\nthan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"\\'\\n\\n\\'I think I should understand that better,\\' Alice said very politely, \\'if\\nI had it written down: but I can\\'t quite follow it as you say it.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\\' the Duchess replied, in\\na pleased tone.\\n\\n\\'Pray don\\'t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\\' said\\nAlice.\\n\\n\\'Oh, don\\'t talk about trouble!\\' said the Duchess. \\'I make you a present\\nof everything I\\'ve said as yet.\\'\\n\\n\\'A cheap sort of present!\\' thought Alice. \\'I\\'m glad they don\\'t give\\nbirthday presents like that!\\' But she did not venture to say it out\\nloud.\\n\\n\\'Thinking again?\\' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve a right to think,\\' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried.\\n\\n\\'Just about as much right,\\' said the Duchess, \\'as pigs have to fly; and\\nthe m--\\'\\n\\nBut here, to Alice\\'s great surprise, the Duchess\\'s voice died away, even\\nin the middle of her favourite word \\'moral,\\' and the arm that was linked\\ninto hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\\nin front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\\n\\n\\'A fine day, your Majesty!\\' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\n\\'Now, I give you fair warning,\\' shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke; \\'either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!\\'\\n\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\n\\'Let\\'s go on with the game,\\' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\\ntoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\\'s absence, and were\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\\'s delay would\\ncost them their lives.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\\nthe other players, and shouting \\'Off with his head!\\' or \\'Off with her\\nhead!\\' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\\nwho of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\\nthe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\\nplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\\nunder sentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \\'Have\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?\\'\\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Alice. \\'I don\\'t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\\' said the Queen.\\n\\n\\'I never saw one, or heard of one,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Come on, then,\\' said the Queen, \\'and he shall tell you his history,\\'\\n\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\nto the company generally, \\'You are all pardoned.\\' \\'Come, THAT\\'S a good\\nthing!\\' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\n\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\\n(IF you don\\'t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \\'Up, lazy\\nthing!\\' said the Queen, \\'and take this young lady to see the Mock\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\nexecutions I have ordered\\'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\\nthe Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\\nthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\\nafter that savage Queen: so she waited.\\n\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. \\'What fun!\\' said the Gryphon,\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\n\\'What IS the fun?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Why, SHE,\\' said the Gryphon. \\'It\\'s all her fancy, that: they never\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!\\'\\n\\n\\'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,\\' thought Alice, as she went slowly\\nafter it: \\'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\\'\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\npitied him deeply. \\'What is his sorrow?\\' she asked the Gryphon, and the\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \\'It\\'s all his\\nfancy, that: he hasn\\'t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\\'\\n\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\n\\'This here young lady,\\' said the Gryphon, \\'she wants for to know your\\nhistory, she do.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll tell it her,\\' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \\'sit\\ndown, both of you, and don\\'t speak a word till I\\'ve finished.\\'\\n\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\nherself, \\'I don\\'t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn\\'t begin.\\' But\\nshe waited patiently.\\n\\n\\'Once,\\' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \\'I was a real\\nTurtle.\\'\\n\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of \\'Hjckrrh!\\' from the Gryphon, and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying, \\'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\\' but she could\\nnot help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\\'When we were little,\\' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, \\'we went to school in the\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--\\'\\n\\n\\'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\\'t one?\\' Alice asked.\\n\\n\\'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\\' said the Mock Turtle\\nangrily: \\'really you are very dull!\\'\\n\\n\\'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\\'\\nadded the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\\nAlice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\\nto the Mock Turtle, \\'Drive on, old fellow! Don\\'t be all day about it!\\'\\nand he went on in these words:\\n\\n\\'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\\'t believe it--\\'\\n\\n\\'I never said I didn\\'t!\\' interrupted Alice.\\n\\n\\'You did,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\'Hold your tongue!\\' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\n\\'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'VE been to a day-school, too,\\' said Alice; \\'you needn\\'t be so proud\\nas all that.\\'\\n\\n\\'With extras?\\' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Alice, \\'we learned French and music.\\'\\n\\n\\'And washing?\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\'Certainly not!\\' said Alice indignantly.\\n\\n\\'Ah! then yours wasn\\'t a really good school,\\' said the Mock Turtle in\\na tone of great relief. \\'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\\n\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"\\'\\n\\n\\'You couldn\\'t have wanted it much,\\' said Alice; \\'living at the bottom of\\nthe sea.\\'\\n\\n\\'I couldn\\'t afford to learn it.\\' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \\'I\\nonly took the regular course.\\'\\n\\n\\'What was that?\\' inquired Alice.\\n\\n\\'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\\' the Mock Turtle\\nreplied; \\'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.\\'\\n\\n\\'I never heard of \"Uglification,\"\\' Alice ventured to say. \\'What is it?\\'\\n\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \\'What! Never heard of\\nuglifying!\\' it exclaimed. \\'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Alice doubtfully: \\'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, then,\\' the Gryphon went on, \\'if you don\\'t know what to uglify is,\\nyou ARE a simpleton.\\'\\n\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\\nturned to the Mock Turtle, and said \\'What else had you to learn?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, there was Mystery,\\' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\\nthe subjects on his flappers, \\'--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\nSeaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\nthat used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.\\'\\n\\n\\'What was THAT like?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Well, I can\\'t show it you myself,\\' the Mock Turtle said: \\'I\\'m too\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Hadn\\'t time,\\' said the Gryphon: \\'I went to the Classics master, though.\\nHe was an old crab, HE was.\\'\\n\\n\\'I never went to him,\\' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \\'he taught\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\\'\\n\\n\\'So he did, so he did,\\' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\n\\'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\\' said Alice, in a hurry to\\nchange the subject.\\n\\n\\'Ten hours the first day,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'nine the next, and so\\non.\\'\\n\\n\\'What a curious plan!\\' exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s the reason they\\'re called lessons,\\' the Gryphon remarked:\\n\\'because they lessen from day to day.\\'\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark. \\'Then the eleventh day must have been a\\nholiday?\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course it was,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\'And how did you manage on the twelfth?\\' Alice went on eagerly.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s enough about lessons,\\' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\\ntone: \\'tell her something about the games now.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \\'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\\'\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:--\\n\\n\\'You may not have lived much under the sea--\\' (\\'I haven\\'t,\\' said\\nAlice)--\\'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--\\'\\n(Alice began to say \\'I once tasted--\\' but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid \\'No, never\\') \\'--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!\\'\\n\\n\\'No, indeed,\\' said Alice. \\'What sort of a dance is it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Why,\\' said the Gryphon, \\'you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore--\\'\\n\\n\\'Two lines!\\' cried the Mock Turtle. \\'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you\\'ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--\\'\\n\\n\\'THAT generally takes some time,\\' interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\'--you advance twice--\\'\\n\\n\\'Each with a lobster as a partner!\\' cried the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\'Of course,\\' the Mock Turtle said: \\'advance twice, set to partners--\\'\\n\\n\\'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,\\' continued the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\'Then, you know,\\' the Mock Turtle went on, \\'you throw the--\\'\\n\\n\\'The lobsters!\\' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\n\\'--as far out to sea as you can--\\'\\n\\n\\'Swim after them!\\' screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\'Turn a somersault in the sea!\\' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\\n\\'Change lobsters again!\\' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\n\\'Back to land again, and that\\'s all the first figure,\\' said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\\njumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\\nand quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\n\\'It must be a very pretty dance,\\' said Alice timidly.\\n\\n\\'Would you like to see a little of it?\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\'Very much indeed,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Come, let\\'s try the first figure!\\' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\\n\\'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, YOU sing,\\' said the Gryphon. \\'I\\'ve forgotten the words.\\'\\n\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:--\\n\\n \\'\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\\n \"There\\'s a porpoise close behind us, and he\\'s treading on my tail.\\n\\n See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\n They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?\\n\\n Will you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\n Will you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\\n\\n \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\n When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\\n But the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance--\\n Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\n\\n Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\n Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n \\'\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\\n \"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\n The further off from England the nearer is to France--\\n Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\n\\n Will you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\n Will you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Thank you, it\\'s a very interesting dance to watch,\\' said Alice, feeling\\nvery glad that it was over at last: \\'and I do so like that curious song\\nabout the whiting!\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, as to the whiting,\\' said the Mock Turtle, \\'they--you\\'ve seen them,\\nof course?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Alice, \\'I\\'ve often seen them at dinn--\\' she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know where Dinn may be,\\' said the Mock Turtle, \\'but if you\\'ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they\\'re like.\\'\\n\\n\\'I believe so,\\' Alice replied thoughtfully. \\'They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths--and they\\'re all over crumbs.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'re wrong about the crumbs,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'crumbs would all\\nwash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the\\nreason is--\\' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--\\'Tell her\\nabout the reason and all that,\\' he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\'The reason is,\\' said the Gryphon, \\'that they WOULD go with the lobsters\\nto the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long\\nway. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\\'t get\\nthem out again. That\\'s all.\\'\\n\\n\\'Thank you,\\' said Alice, \\'it\\'s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.\\'\\n\\n\\'I can tell you more than that, if you like,\\' said the Gryphon. \\'Do you\\nknow why it\\'s called a whiting?\\'\\n\\n\\'I never thought about it,\\' said Alice. \\'Why?\\'\\n\\n\\'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.\\' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\n\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \\'Does the boots and shoes!\\' she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\\n\\'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?\\' said the Gryphon. \\'I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?\\'\\n\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. \\'They\\'re done with blacking, I believe.\\'\\n\\n\\'Boots and shoes under the sea,\\' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n\\'are done with a whiting. Now you know.\\'\\n\\n\\'And what are they made of?\\' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\n\\'Soles and eels, of course,\\' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n\\'any shrimp could have told you that.\\'\\n\\n\\'If I\\'d been the whiting,\\' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\\non the song, \\'I\\'d have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we\\ndon\\'t want YOU with us!\"\\'\\n\\n\\'They were obliged to have him with them,\\' the Mock Turtle said: \\'no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\\'\\n\\n\\'Wouldn\\'t it really?\\' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n\\'Of course not,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'why, if a fish came to ME, and\\ntold me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you mean \"purpose\"?\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'I mean what I say,\\' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added \\'Come, let\\'s hear some of YOUR adventures.\\'\\n\\n\\'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\\' said\\nAlice a little timidly: \\'but it\\'s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.\\'\\n\\n\\'Explain all that,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\'No, no! The adventures first,\\' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n\\'explanations take such a dreadful time.\\'\\n\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\\non. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\\nher repeating \\'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\\' to the Caterpillar, and the\\nwords all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,\\nand said \\'That\\'s very curious.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s all about as curious as it can be,\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\'It all came different!\\' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \\'I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.\\' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\\n\\'Stand up and repeat \"\\'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"\\' said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n\\'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\\'\\nthought Alice; \\'I might as well be at school at once.\\' However, she\\ngot up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:--\\n\\n  \\'\\'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n  \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\\n  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\n  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\\'\\n\\n       [later editions continued as follows\\n  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\n  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\n  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\n  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\\n\\'That\\'s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\\' said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n\\'Well, I never heard it before,\\' said the Mock Turtle; \\'but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.\\'\\n\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.\\n\\n\\'I should like to have it explained,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\'She can\\'t explain it,\\' said the Gryphon hastily. \\'Go on with the next\\nverse.\\'\\n\\n\\'But about his toes?\\' the Mock Turtle persisted. \\'How COULD he turn them\\nout with his nose, you know?\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s the first position in dancing.\\' Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\n\\'Go on with the next verse,\\' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \\'it\\nbegins \"I passed by his garden.\"\\'\\n\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\\n\\n  \\'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\n  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--\\'\\n\\n    [later editions continued as follows\\n  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\n  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\n  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\n  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\n  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\n  And concluded the banquet--]\\n\\n\\'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,\\' the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, \\'if you don\\'t explain it as you go on? It\\'s by far the most\\nconfusing thing I ever heard!\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, I think you\\'d better leave off,\\' said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\\n\\'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\\' the Gryphon went\\non. \\'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\\' Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n\\'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \"Turtle Soup,\" will you, old\\nfellow?\\'\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:--\\n\\n   \\'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\n   Waiting in a hot tureen!\\n   Who for such dainties would not stoop?\\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\n   \\'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\n   Game, or any other dish?\\n   Who would not give all else for two\\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\\n     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!\\'\\n\\n\\'Chorus again!\\' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of \\'The trial\\'s beginning!\\' was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\\n\\'Come on!\\' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\n\\n\\'What trial is it?\\' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\nanswered \\'Come on!\\' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--\\n\\n   \\'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\\nand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\\nthat it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\\'I wish they\\'d get the\\ntrial done,\\' she thought, \\'and hand round the refreshments!\\' But there\\nseemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\\nher, to pass away the time.\\n\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there. \\'That\\'s the judge,\\' she said to\\nherself, \\'because of his great wig.\\'\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\\nnot look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\n\\'And that\\'s the jury-box,\\' thought Alice, \\'and those twelve creatures,\\'\\n(she was obliged to say \\'creatures,\\' you see, because some of them were\\nanimals, and some were birds,) \\'I suppose they are the jurors.\\' She said\\nthis last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\\nit: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\\nage knew the meaning of it at all. However, \\'jury-men\\' would have done\\njust as well.\\n\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \\'What are they\\ndoing?\\' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \\'They can\\'t have anything to put\\ndown yet, before the trial\\'s begun.\\'\\n\\n\\'They\\'re putting down their names,\\' the Gryphon whispered in reply, \\'for\\nfear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\\'\\n\\n\\'Stupid things!\\' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\\nhastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \\'Silence in the court!\\' and the\\nKing put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\\nwas talking.\\n\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\nthat all the jurors were writing down \\'stupid things!\\' on their slates,\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn\\'t know how to spell\\n\\'stupid,\\' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \\'A nice\\nmuddle their slates\\'ll be in before the trial\\'s over!\\' thought Alice.\\n\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\ncould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\\nobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\\nof very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\n\\'Herald, read the accusation!\\' said the King.\\n\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\\n\\n   \\'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n      All on a summer day:\\n    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\n      And took them quite away!\\'\\n\\n\\'Consider your verdict,\\' the King said to the jury.\\n\\n\\'Not yet, not yet!\\' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \\'There\\'s a great\\ndeal to come before that!\\'\\n\\n\\'Call the first witness,\\' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\\nblasts on the trumpet, and called out, \\'First witness!\\'\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\\nhand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \\'I beg pardon, your\\nMajesty,\\' he began, \\'for bringing these in: but I hadn\\'t quite finished\\nmy tea when I was sent for.\\'\\n\\n\\'You ought to have finished,\\' said the King. \\'When did you begin?\\'\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \\'Fourteenth of March, I think it\\nwas,\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'Fifteenth,\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\'Sixteenth,\\' added the Dormouse.\\n\\n\\'Write that down,\\' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\n\\'Take off your hat,\\' the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\n\\'It isn\\'t mine,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\'Stolen!\\' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\\nmemorandum of the fact.\\n\\n\\'I keep them to sell,\\' the Hatter added as an explanation; \\'I\\'ve none of\\nmy own. I\\'m a hatter.\\'\\n\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\n\\'Give your evidence,\\' said the King; \\'and don\\'t be nervous, or I\\'ll have\\nyou executed on the spot.\\'\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\\nhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\\nlong as there was room for her.\\n\\n\\'I wish you wouldn\\'t squeeze so.\\' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her. \\'I can hardly breathe.\\'\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t help it,\\' said Alice very meekly: \\'I\\'m growing.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'ve no right to grow here,\\' said the Dormouse.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t talk nonsense,\\' said Alice more boldly: \\'you know you\\'re growing\\ntoo.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\\' said the Dormouse: \\'not in that\\nridiculous fashion.\\' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\\nother side of the court.\\n\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, \\'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\\' on\\nwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\\n\\n\\'Give your evidence,\\' the King repeated angrily, \\'or I\\'ll have you\\nexecuted, whether you\\'re nervous or not.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m a poor man, your Majesty,\\' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n\\'--and I hadn\\'t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\\'\\n\\n\\'The twinkling of the what?\\' said the King.\\n\\n\\'It began with the tea,\\' the Hatter replied.\\n\\n\\'Of course twinkling begins with a T!\\' said the King sharply. \\'Do you\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m a poor man,\\' the Hatter went on, \\'and most things twinkled after\\nthat--only the March Hare said--\\'\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t!\\' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\n\\'You did!\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\'I deny it!\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\'He denies it,\\' said the King: \\'leave out that part.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\\' the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\n\\'After that,\\' continued the Hatter, \\'I cut some more bread-and-butter--\\'\\n\\n\\'But what did the Dormouse say?\\' one of the jury asked.\\n\\n\\'That I can\\'t remember,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\'You MUST remember,\\' remarked the King, \\'or I\\'ll have you executed.\\'\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee. \\'I\\'m a poor man, your Majesty,\\' he began.\\n\\n\\'You\\'re a very poor speaker,\\' said the King.\\n\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\n\\n\\'I\\'m glad I\\'ve seen that done,\\' thought Alice. \\'I\\'ve so often read\\nin the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\\nat applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.\\'\\n\\n\\'If that\\'s all you know about it, you may stand down,\\' continued the\\nKing.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t go no lower,\\' said the Hatter: \\'I\\'m on the floor, as it is.\\'\\n\\n\\'Then you may SIT down,\\' the King replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\n\\'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\\' thought Alice. \\'Now we shall get\\non better.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'d rather finish my tea,\\' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the\\nQueen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\n\\'You may go,\\' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n\\'--and just take his head off outside,\\' the Queen added to one of the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\\n\\n\\'Call the next witness!\\' said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess\\'s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n\\'Give your evidence,\\' said the King.\\n\\n\\'Shan\\'t,\\' said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n\\'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, if I must, I must,\\' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \\'What are tarts made of?\\'\\n\\n\\'Pepper, mostly,\\' said the cook.\\n\\n\\'Treacle,\\' said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\n\\'Collar that Dormouse,\\' the Queen shrieked out. \\'Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\nwhiskers!\\'\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\'Never mind!\\' said the King, with an air of great relief. \\'Call the next\\nwitness.\\' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \\'Really, my dear,\\nYOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead\\nache!\\'\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like, \\'--for they haven\\'t\\ngot much evidence YET,\\' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when\\nthe White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\\nname \\'Alice!\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. Alice\\'s Evidence\\n\\n\\n\\'Here!\\' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\\nshe had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\n\\'Oh, I BEG your pardon!\\' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\\nthe goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\\nthat they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\\nthey would die.\\n\\n\\'The trial cannot proceed,\\' said the King in a very grave voice, \\'until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,\\' he repeated with\\ngreat emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\\n\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got\\nit out again, and put it right; \\'not that it signifies much,\\' she said\\nto herself; \\'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\\none way up as the other.\\'\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\\n\\'What do you know about this business?\\' the King said to Alice.\\n\\n\\'Nothing,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Nothing WHATEVER?\\' persisted the King.\\n\\n\\'Nothing whatever,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s very important,\\' the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\\ninterrupted: \\'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,\\' he said in a\\nvery respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\\n\\n\\'UNimportant, of course, I meant,\\' the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\\n\\'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--\\' as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it down \\'important,\\' and some \\'unimportant.\\'\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n\\'but it doesn\\'t matter a bit,\\' she thought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out \\'Silence!\\' and read out from his book, \\'Rule\\nForty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.\\'\\n\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\n\\'I\\'M not a mile high,\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'You are,\\' said the King.\\n\\n\\'Nearly two miles high,\\' added the Queen.\\n\\n\\'Well, I shan\\'t go, at any rate,\\' said Alice: \\'besides, that\\'s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s the oldest rule in the book,\\' said the King.\\n\\n\\'Then it ought to be Number One,\\' said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \\'Consider your\\nverdict,\\' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\\' said the White\\nRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \\'this paper has just been picked\\nup.\\'\\n\\n\\'What\\'s in it?\\' said the Queen.\\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t opened it yet,\\' said the White Rabbit, \\'but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\\'\\n\\n\\'It must have been that,\\' said the King, \\'unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn\\'t usual, you know.\\'\\n\\n\\'Who is it directed to?\\' said one of the jurymen.\\n\\n\\'It isn\\'t directed at all,\\' said the White Rabbit; \\'in fact, there\\'s\\nnothing written on the OUTSIDE.\\' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and\\nadded \\'It isn\\'t a letter, after all: it\\'s a set of verses.\\'\\n\\n\\'Are they in the prisoner\\'s handwriting?\\' asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\n\\'No, they\\'re not,\\' said the White Rabbit, \\'and that\\'s the queerest thing\\nabout it.\\' (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\\n\\'He must have imitated somebody else\\'s hand,\\' said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\\n\\'Please your Majesty,\\' said the Knave, \\'I didn\\'t write it, and they\\ncan\\'t prove I did: there\\'s no name signed at the end.\\'\\n\\n\\'If you didn\\'t sign it,\\' said the King, \\'that only makes the matter\\nworse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\\'d have signed your\\nname like an honest man.\\'\\n\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\n\\'That PROVES his guilt,\\' said the Queen.\\n\\n\\'It proves nothing of the sort!\\' said Alice. \\'Why, you don\\'t even know\\nwhat they\\'re about!\\'\\n\\n\\'Read them,\\' said the King.\\n\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \\'Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\\'Begin at the beginning,\\' the King said gravely, \\'and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.\\'\\n\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\\n\\n   \\'They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\n   She gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\n   He sent them word I had not gone\\n    (We know it to be true):\\n   If she should push the matter on,\\n    What would become of you?\\n\\n   I gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\n   They all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\n   If I or she should chance to be\\n    Involved in this affair,\\n   He trusts to you to set them free,\\n    Exactly as we were.\\n\\n   My notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\n   An obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\n   Don\\'t let him know she liked them best,\\n    For this must ever be\\n   A secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s the most important piece of evidence we\\'ve heard yet,\\' said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; \\'so now let the jury--\\'\\n\\n\\'If any one of them can explain it,\\' said Alice, (she had grown so large\\nin the last few minutes that she wasn\\'t a bit afraid of interrupting\\nhim,) \\'I\\'ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\\'t believe there\\'s an atom of\\nmeaning in it.\\'\\n\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \\'SHE doesn\\'t believe there\\'s an\\natom of meaning in it,\\' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\\n\\n\\'If there\\'s no meaning in it,\\' said the King, \\'that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn\\'t try to find any. And yet I don\\'t know,\\'\\nhe went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them\\nwith one eye; \\'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \"--SAID\\nI COULD NOT SWIM--\" you can\\'t swim, can you?\\' he added, turning to the\\nKnave.\\n\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. \\'Do I look like it?\\' he said. (Which he\\ncertainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\\n\\'All right, so far,\\' said the King, and he went on muttering over\\nthe verses to himself: \\'\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that\\'s the jury, of\\ncourse--\"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know--\\'\\n\\n\\'But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Why, there they are!\\' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts\\non the table. \\'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\"BEFORE SHE\\nHAD THIS FIT--\" you never had fits, my dear, I think?\\' he said to the\\nQueen.\\n\\n\\'Never!\\' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as\\nit lasted.)\\n\\n\\'Then the words don\\'t FIT you,\\' said the King, looking round the court\\nwith a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a pun!\\' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\\n\\'Let the jury consider their verdict,\\' the King said, for about the\\ntwentieth time that day.\\n\\n\\'No, no!\\' said the Queen. \\'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\\'\\n\\n\\'Stuff and nonsense!\\' said Alice loudly. \\'The idea of having the\\nsentence first!\\'\\n\\n\\'Hold your tongue!\\' said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n\\'I won\\'t!\\' said Alice.\\n\\n\\'Off with her head!\\' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n\\'Who cares for you?\\' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\\ntime.) \\'You\\'re nothing but a pack of cards!\\'\\n\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n\\'Wake up, Alice dear!\\' said her sister; \\'Why, what a long sleep you\\'ve\\nhad!\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I\\'ve had such a curious dream!\\' said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures\\nof hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\\nfinished, her sister kissed her, and said, \\'It WAS a curious dream,\\ndear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\\'s getting late.\\' So\\nAlice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\n\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\\nwonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\\nthis was her dream:--\\n\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\\nup into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\\nqueer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\\nWOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\\nlisten, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\\nof her little sister\\'s dream.\\n\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess\\'s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard\\'s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\\n\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\\'s shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\\nknew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\\nof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\\'s\\nheavy sobs.\\n\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\\nmake THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\\nwith the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\\nall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\\n\\n              THE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by\\nguesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and\\nsupport of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\\n\\nI make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers\\nwould suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and\\nnot succeeding.\\n\\nTHE AUTHOR.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHUCKLEBERRY FINN\\n\\nScene: \\ufffdThe Mississippi Valley Time: \\ufffdForty to fifty years ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nYOU don\\'t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\\'t no matter. \\ufffdThat book was made\\nby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. \\ufffdThere was things\\nwhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. \\ufffdThat is nothing. \\ufffdI\\nnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\\nPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. \\ufffdAunt Polly--Tom\\'s Aunt Polly, she\\nis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\\nis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\\n\\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: \\ufffdTom and me found the money\\nthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. \\ufffdWe got six\\nthousand dollars apiece--all gold. \\ufffdIt was an awful sight of money when\\nit was piled up. \\ufffdWell, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\\nat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\\nround--more than a body could tell what to do with. \\ufffdThe Widow Douglas\\nshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\\nrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\\nand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\\'t stand\\nit no longer I lit out. \\ufffdI got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\\nagain, and was free and satisfied. \\ufffdBut Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\\nsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\\nwould go back to the widow and be respectable. \\ufffdSo I went back.\\n\\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\\ncalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\\nit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\\'t do nothing but\\nsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. \\ufffdWell, then, the old thing\\ncommenced again. \\ufffdThe widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\\nto time. When you got to the table you couldn\\'t go right to eating, but\\nyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\\nover the victuals, though there warn\\'t really anything the matter with\\nthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. \\ufffdIn a\\nbarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\\njuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\\n\\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\\nBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\\nby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\\nthen I didn\\'t care no more about him, because I don\\'t take no stock in\\ndead people.\\n\\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. \\ufffdBut she\\nwouldn\\'t. \\ufffdShe said it was a mean practice and wasn\\'t clean, and I must\\ntry to not do it any more. \\ufffdThat is just the way with some people. \\ufffdThey\\nget down on a thing when they don\\'t know nothing about it. \\ufffdHere she was\\na-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\\nbeing gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\\nthing that had some good in it. \\ufffdAnd she took snuff, too; of course that\\nwas all right, because she done it herself.\\n\\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\\nhad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\\nspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\\nthe widow made her ease up. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t stood it much longer. \\ufffdThen for\\nan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. \\ufffdMiss Watson would say,\\n\"Don\\'t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\" and \"Don\\'t scrunch up\\nlike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;\" and pretty soon she would\\nsay, \"Don\\'t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don\\'t you try to\\nbehave?\" \\ufffdThen she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\\nI was there. She got mad then, but I didn\\'t mean no harm. \\ufffdAll I wanted\\nwas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\\'t particular.\\n\\ufffdShe said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn\\'t say it for\\nthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\\n\\ufffdWell, I couldn\\'t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\\nmade up my mind I wouldn\\'t try for it. \\ufffdBut I never said so, because it\\nwould only make trouble, and wouldn\\'t do no good.\\n\\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\\nplace. \\ufffdShe said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\\nday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. \\ufffdSo I didn\\'t think\\nmuch of it. But I never said so. \\ufffdI asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\\nwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. \\ufffdI was glad\\nabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\\n\\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\\n\\ufffdBy and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\\neverybody was off to bed. \\ufffdI went up to my room with a piece of candle,\\nand put it on the table. \\ufffdThen I set down in a chair by the window and\\ntried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\\'t no use. \\ufffdI felt\\nso lonesome I most wished I was dead. \\ufffdThe stars were shining, and the\\nleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\\noff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\\ndog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\\nto whisper something to me, and I couldn\\'t make out what it was, and so\\nit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\\nthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\\nsomething that\\'s on its mind and can\\'t make itself understood, and so\\ncan\\'t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\\ngrieving. \\ufffdI got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\\ncompany. \\ufffdPretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\\nflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\\nwas all shriveled up. \\ufffdI didn\\'t need anybody to tell me that that was\\nan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\\nand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\\ntracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\\nup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. \\ufffdBut\\nI hadn\\'t no confidence. \\ufffdYou do that when you\\'ve lost a horseshoe that\\nyou\\'ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn\\'t ever\\nheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\\'d killed\\na spider.\\n\\nI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\\nfor the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn\\'t\\nknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\\ngo boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\\never. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\\ntrees--something was a stirring. \\ufffdI set still and listened. \\ufffdDirectly I\\ncould just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there. \\ufffdThat was good!\\n\\ufffdSays I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the\\nlight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. \\ufffdThen I slipped\\ndown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\\nthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\\nthe widow\\'s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\\'t scrape our\\nheads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\\na noise. \\ufffdWe scrouched down and laid still. \\ufffdMiss Watson\\'s big nigger,\\nnamed Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\\nclear, because there was a light behind him. \\ufffdHe got up and stretched\\nhis neck out about a minute, listening. \\ufffdThen he says:\\n\\n\"Who dah?\"\\n\\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\\nbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly. \\ufffdWell, likely it was\\nminutes and minutes that there warn\\'t a sound, and we all there so close\\ntogether. \\ufffdThere was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\\ndasn\\'t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\\nright between my shoulders. \\ufffdSeemed like I\\'d die if I couldn\\'t scratch.\\n\\ufffdWell, I\\'ve noticed that thing plenty times since. \\ufffdIf you are with\\nthe quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\\'t\\nsleepy--if you are anywheres where it won\\'t do for you to scratch, why\\nyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Say, who is you? \\ufffdWhar is you? \\ufffdDog my cats ef I didn\\' hear sumf\\'n.\\nWell, I know what I\\'s gwyne to do: \\ufffdI\\'s gwyne to set down here and\\nlisten tell I hears it agin.\"\\n\\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. \\ufffdHe leaned his back up\\nagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\\none of mine. \\ufffdMy nose begun to itch. \\ufffdIt itched till the tears come into\\nmy eyes. \\ufffdBut I dasn\\'t scratch. \\ufffdThen it begun to itch on the inside.\\nNext I got to itching underneath. \\ufffdI didn\\'t know how I was going to set\\nstill. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\\nit seemed a sight longer than that. \\ufffdI was itching in eleven different\\nplaces now. \\ufffdI reckoned I couldn\\'t stand it more\\'n a minute longer,\\nbut I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. \\ufffdJust then Jim begun\\nto breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\\ncomfortable again.\\n\\nTom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\\nwent creeping away on our hands and knees. \\ufffdWhen we was ten foot off Tom\\nwhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. \\ufffdBut I said\\nno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\\'d find out I\\nwarn\\'t in. Then Tom said he hadn\\'t got candles enough, and he would slip\\nin the kitchen and get some more. \\ufffdI didn\\'t want him to try. \\ufffdI said Jim\\nmight wake up and come. \\ufffdBut Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\\nand got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\\nThen we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\\nTom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\\nsomething on him. \\ufffdI waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\\nso still and lonesome.\\n\\nAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\\nand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\\nthe house. \\ufffdTom said he slipped Jim\\'s hat off of his head and hung it\\non a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn\\'t wake.\\nAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\\nand rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\\nand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. \\ufffdAnd next time Jim told\\nit he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\\ntime he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\\nrode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\\nwas all over saddle-boils. \\ufffdJim was monstrous proud about it, and he\\ngot so he wouldn\\'t hardly notice the other niggers. \\ufffdNiggers would come\\nmiles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\\nnigger in that country. \\ufffdStrange niggers would stand with their mouths\\nopen and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. \\ufffdNiggers is\\nalways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\\nwhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\\nJim would happen in and say, \"Hm! \\ufffdWhat you know \\'bout witches?\" and\\nthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. \\ufffdJim always kept\\nthat five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\\ncharm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\\ncure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\\nsaying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\\n\\ufffdNiggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\\nhad, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn\\'t touch\\nit, because the devil had had his hands on it. \\ufffdJim was most ruined for\\na servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\\nand been rode by witches.\\n\\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\\ninto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\\nthere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\\nso fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\\nawful still and grand. \\ufffdWe went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\\nBen Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\\n\\ufffdSo we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\\nto the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\\n\\nWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\\nsecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\\npart of the bushes. \\ufffdThen we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\\nhands and knees. \\ufffdWe went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\\nopened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\\nunder a wall where you wouldn\\'t a noticed that there was a hole. \\ufffdWe\\nwent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\\nsweaty and cold, and there we stopped. \\ufffdTom says:\\n\\n\"Now, we\\'ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\\'s Gang.\\nEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\\nin blood.\"\\n\\nEverybody was willing. \\ufffdSo Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\\nwrote the oath on, and read it. \\ufffdIt swore every boy to stick to the\\nband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\\nany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\\nhis family must do it, and he mustn\\'t eat and he mustn\\'t sleep till he\\nhad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\\nof the band. And nobody that didn\\'t belong to the band could use that\\nmark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\\nkilled. \\ufffdAnd if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\\nmust have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\\nashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\\nblood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\\nand be forgot forever.\\n\\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\\nit out of his own head. \\ufffdHe said, some of it, but the rest was out of\\npirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\\nit.\\n\\nSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\\nthe secrets. \\ufffdTom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\\nit in. Then Ben Rogers says:\\n\\n\"Here\\'s Huck Finn, he hain\\'t got no family; what you going to do \\'bout\\nhim?\"\\n\\n\"Well, hain\\'t he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer.\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'s got a father, but you can\\'t never find him these days. \\ufffdHe\\nused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\\'t been seen\\nin these parts for a year or more.\"\\n\\nThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\\nsaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\\nwouldn\\'t be fair and square for the others. \\ufffdWell, nobody could think of\\nanything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. \\ufffdI was most ready\\nto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\\nWatson--they could kill her. \\ufffdEverybody said:\\n\\n\"Oh, she\\'ll do. \\ufffdThat\\'s all right. \\ufffdHuck can come in.\"\\n\\nThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\\nand I made my mark on the paper.\\n\\n\"Now,\" says Ben Rogers, \"what\\'s the line of business of this Gang?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing only robbery and murder,\" Tom said.\\n\\n\"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\"\\n\\n\"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\\'t robbery; it\\'s burglary,\"\\nsays Tom Sawyer. \\ufffd\"We ain\\'t burglars. \\ufffdThat ain\\'t no sort of style. \\ufffdWe\\nare highwaymen. \\ufffdWe stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\\non, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\"\\n\\n\"Must we always kill the people?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly. \\ufffdIt\\'s best. \\ufffdSome authorities think different, but\\nmostly it\\'s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\\nthe cave here, and keep them till they\\'re ransomed.\"\\n\\n\"Ransomed? \\ufffdWhat\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. \\ufffdBut that\\'s what they do. \\ufffdI\\'ve seen it in books; and so\\nof course that\\'s what we\\'ve got to do.\"\\n\\n\"But how can we do it if we don\\'t know what it is?\"\\n\\n\"Why, blame it all, we\\'ve _got_ to do it. \\ufffdDon\\'t I tell you it\\'s in the\\nbooks? \\ufffdDo you want to go to doing different from what\\'s in the books,\\nand get things all muddled up?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\\nare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don\\'t know how to do it\\nto them?--that\\'s the thing I want to get at. \\ufffdNow, what do you reckon it\\nis?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know. \\ufffdBut per\\'aps if we keep them till they\\'re ransomed,\\nit means that we keep them till they\\'re dead.\"\\n\\n\"Now, that\\'s something _like_. \\ufffdThat\\'ll answer. \\ufffdWhy couldn\\'t you said\\nthat before? \\ufffdWe\\'ll keep them till they\\'re ransomed to death; and a\\nbothersome lot they\\'ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying\\nto get loose.\"\\n\\n\"How you talk, Ben Rogers. \\ufffdHow can they get loose when there\\'s a guard\\nover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\"\\n\\n\"A guard! \\ufffdWell, that _is_ good. \\ufffdSo somebody\\'s got to set up all night\\nand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. \\ufffdI think that\\'s\\nfoolishness. Why can\\'t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\\nthey get here?\"\\n\\n\"Because it ain\\'t in the books so--that\\'s why. \\ufffdNow, Ben Rogers, do you\\nwant to do things regular, or don\\'t you?--that\\'s the idea. \\ufffdDon\\'t you\\nreckon that the people that made the books knows what\\'s the correct\\nthing to do? \\ufffdDo you reckon _you_ can learn \\'em anything? \\ufffdNot by a good\\ndeal. No, sir, we\\'ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\"\\n\\n\"All right. \\ufffdI don\\'t mind; but I say it\\'s a fool way, anyhow. \\ufffdSay, do\\nwe kill the women, too?\"\\n\\n\"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn\\'t let on. \\ufffdKill\\nthe women? \\ufffdNo; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. \\ufffdYou\\nfetch them to the cave, and you\\'re always as polite as pie to them;\\nand by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if that\\'s the way I\\'m agreed, but I don\\'t take no stock in it.\\nMighty soon we\\'ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows\\nwaiting to be ransomed, that there won\\'t be no place for the robbers.\\nBut go ahead, I ain\\'t got nothing to say.\"\\n\\nLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was\\nscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn\\'t\\nwant to be a robber any more.\\n\\nSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him\\nmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. \\ufffdBut\\nTom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and\\nmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.\\n\\nBen Rogers said he couldn\\'t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted\\nto begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it\\non Sunday, and that settled the thing. \\ufffdThey agreed to get together and\\nfix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first\\ncaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.\\n\\nI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was\\nbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was\\ndog-tired.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nWELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on\\naccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn\\'t scold, but only cleaned\\noff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would\\nbehave awhile if I could. \\ufffdThen Miss Watson she took me in the closet\\nand prayed, but nothing come of it. \\ufffdShe told me to pray every day, and\\nwhatever I asked for I would get it. \\ufffdBut it warn\\'t so. \\ufffdI tried it.\\nOnce I got a fish-line, but no hooks. \\ufffdIt warn\\'t any good to me without\\nhooks. \\ufffdI tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I\\ncouldn\\'t make it work. \\ufffdBy and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to\\ntry for me, but she said I was a fool. \\ufffdShe never told me why, and I\\ncouldn\\'t make it out no way.\\n\\nI set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.\\n\\ufffdI says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don\\'t\\nDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? \\ufffdWhy can\\'t the widow get\\nback her silver snuffbox that was stole? \\ufffdWhy can\\'t Miss Watson fat up?\\nNo, says I to my self, there ain\\'t nothing in it. \\ufffdI went and told the\\nwidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for\\nit was \"spiritual gifts.\" \\ufffdThis was too many for me, but she told me\\nwhat she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for\\nother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about\\nmyself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. \\ufffdI went out in the\\nwoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn\\'t see no\\nadvantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned\\nI wouldn\\'t worry about it any more, but just let it go. \\ufffdSometimes the\\nwidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make\\na body\\'s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold\\nand knock it all down again. \\ufffdI judged I could see that there was two\\nProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the\\nwidow\\'s Providence, but if Miss Watson\\'s got him there warn\\'t no help\\nfor him any more. \\ufffdI thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong\\nto the widow\\'s if he wanted me, though I couldn\\'t make out how he was\\na-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was\\nso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.\\n\\nPap he hadn\\'t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable\\nfor me; I didn\\'t want to see him no more. \\ufffdHe used to always whale me\\nwhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take\\nto the woods most of the time when he was around. \\ufffdWell, about this time\\nhe was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so\\npeople said. \\ufffdThey judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was\\njust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all\\nlike pap; but they couldn\\'t make nothing out of the face, because it had\\nbeen in the water so long it warn\\'t much like a face at all. \\ufffdThey said\\nhe was floating on his back in the water. \\ufffdThey took him and buried him\\non the bank. \\ufffdBut I warn\\'t comfortable long, because I happened to think\\nof something. \\ufffdI knowed mighty well that a drownded man don\\'t float on\\nhis back, but on his face. \\ufffdSo I knowed, then, that this warn\\'t pap, but\\na woman dressed up in a man\\'s clothes. \\ufffdSo I was uncomfortable again.\\n\\ufffdI judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he\\nwouldn\\'t.\\n\\nWe played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. \\ufffdAll\\nthe boys did. \\ufffdWe hadn\\'t robbed nobody, hadn\\'t killed any people, but\\nonly just pretended. \\ufffdWe used to hop out of the woods and go charging\\ndown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,\\nbut we never hived any of them. \\ufffdTom Sawyer called the hogs \"ingots,\"\\nand he called the turnips and stuff \"julery,\" and we would go to the\\ncave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed\\nand marked. \\ufffdBut I couldn\\'t see no profit in it. \\ufffdOne time Tom sent a\\nboy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan\\n(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he\\nhad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish\\nmerchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two\\nhundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand \"sumter\"\\nmules, all loaded down with di\\'monds, and they didn\\'t have only a guard\\nof four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called\\nit, and kill the lot and scoop the things. \\ufffdHe said we must slick up\\nour swords and guns, and get ready. \\ufffdHe never could go after even a\\nturnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,\\nthough they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them\\ntill you rotted, and then they warn\\'t worth a mouthful of ashes more\\nthan what they was before. \\ufffdI didn\\'t believe we could lick such a crowd\\nof Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,\\nso I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got\\nthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. \\ufffdBut there warn\\'t\\nno Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn\\'t no camels nor no elephants.\\n\\ufffdIt warn\\'t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class\\nat that. \\ufffdWe busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we\\nnever got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got\\na rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the\\nteacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.\\n\\n\\ufffdI didn\\'t see no di\\'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. \\ufffdHe said there was\\nloads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,\\nand elephants and things. \\ufffdI said, why couldn\\'t we see them, then? \\ufffdHe\\nsaid if I warn\\'t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I\\nwould know without asking. \\ufffdHe said it was all done by enchantment. \\ufffdHe\\nsaid there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,\\nand so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had\\nturned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.\\n\\ufffdI said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the\\nmagicians. \\ufffdTom Sawyer said I was a numskull.\\n\\n\"Why,\" said he, \"a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they\\nwould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. \\ufffdThey\\nare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I says, \"s\\'pose we got some genies to help _us_--can\\'t we lick\\nthe other crowd then?\"\\n\\n\"How you going to get them?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. \\ufffdHow do _they_ get them?\"\\n\\n\"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies\\ncome tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the\\nsmoke a-rolling, and everything they\\'re told to do they up and do it.\\n\\ufffdThey don\\'t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and\\nbelting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any\\nother man.\"\\n\\n\"Who makes them tear around so?\"\\n\\n\"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. \\ufffdThey belong to whoever rubs\\nthe lamp or the ring, and they\\'ve got to do whatever he says. \\ufffdIf he\\ntells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di\\'monds, and fill\\nit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor\\'s\\ndaughter from China for you to marry, they\\'ve got to do it--and they\\'ve\\ngot to do it before sun-up next morning, too. \\ufffdAnd more: \\ufffdthey\\'ve got\\nto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says I, \"I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping\\nthe palace themselves \\'stead of fooling them away like that. \\ufffdAnd what\\'s\\nmore--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would\\ndrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.\"\\n\\n\"How you talk, Huck Finn. \\ufffdWhy, you\\'d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,\\nwhether you wanted to or not.\"\\n\\n\"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? \\ufffdAll right, then;\\nI _would_ come; but I lay I\\'d make that man climb the highest tree there\\nwas in the country.\"\\n\\n\"Shucks, it ain\\'t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. \\ufffdYou don\\'t seem to\\nknow anything, somehow--perfect saphead.\"\\n\\nI thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I\\nwould see if there was anything in it. \\ufffdI got an old tin lamp and an\\niron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat\\nlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn\\'t\\nno use, none of the genies come. \\ufffdSo then I judged that all that stuff\\nwas only just one of Tom Sawyer\\'s lies. \\ufffdI reckoned he believed in the\\nA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. \\ufffdIt had all\\nthe marks of a Sunday-school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nWELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and\\nwrite just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six\\ntimes seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get any\\nfurther than that if I was to live forever. \\ufffdI don\\'t take no stock in\\nmathematics, anyway.\\n\\nAt first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.\\nWhenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next\\nday done me good and cheered me up. \\ufffdSo the longer I went to school the\\neasier it got to be. \\ufffdI was getting sort of used to the widow\\'s ways,\\ntoo, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me. \\ufffdLiving in a house and sleeping in\\na bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I\\nused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a\\nrest to me. \\ufffdI liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the\\nnew ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but\\nsure, and doing very satisfactory. \\ufffdShe said she warn\\'t ashamed of me.\\n\\nOne morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.\\n\\ufffdI reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,\\nand crossed me off. She says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what\\na mess you are always making!\" \\ufffdThe widow put in a good word for me, but\\nthat warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.\\n\\ufffdI started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.\\n\\ufffdThere is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t one\\nof them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along\\nlow-spirited and on the watch-out.\\n\\nI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\\nthrough the high board fence. \\ufffdThere was an inch of new snow on the\\nground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks. \\ufffdThey had come up from the quarry\\nand stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden\\nfence. \\ufffdIt was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so. \\ufffdI\\ncouldn\\'t make it out. \\ufffdIt was very curious, somehow. \\ufffdI was going to\\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. \\ufffdI didn\\'t\\nnotice anything at first, but next I did. \\ufffdThere was a cross in the left\\nboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.\\n\\nI was up in a second and shinning down the hill. \\ufffdI looked over my\\nshoulder every now and then, but I didn\\'t see nobody. \\ufffdI was at Judge\\nThatcher\\'s as quick as I could get there. \\ufffdHe said:\\n\\n\"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. \\ufffdDid you come for your\\ninterest?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I says; \"is there some for me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty\\ndollars. \\ufffdQuite a fortune for you. \\ufffdYou had better let me invest it\\nalong with your six thousand, because if you take it you\\'ll spend it.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I says, \"I don\\'t want to spend it. \\ufffdI don\\'t want it at\\nall--nor the six thousand, nuther. \\ufffdI want you to take it; I want to give\\nit to you--the six thousand and all.\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised. \\ufffdHe couldn\\'t seem to make it out. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Why, what can you mean, my boy?\"\\n\\nI says, \"Don\\'t you ask me no questions about it, please. \\ufffdYou\\'ll take\\nit--won\\'t you?\"\\n\\nHe says:\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m puzzled. \\ufffdIs something the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Please take it,\" says I, \"and don\\'t ask me nothing--then I won\\'t have to\\ntell no lies.\"\\n\\nHe studied a while, and then he says:\\n\\n\"Oho-o! \\ufffdI think I see. \\ufffdYou want to _sell_ all your property to me--not\\ngive it. \\ufffdThat\\'s the correct idea.\"\\n\\nThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:\\n\\n\"There; you see it says \\'for a consideration.\\' \\ufffdThat means I have bought\\nit of you and paid you for it. \\ufffdHere\\'s a dollar for you. \\ufffdNow you sign\\nit.\"\\n\\nSo I signed it, and left.\\n\\nMiss Watson\\'s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which\\nhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do\\nmagic with it. \\ufffdHe said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed\\neverything. \\ufffdSo I went to him that night and told him pap was here\\nagain, for I found his tracks in the snow. \\ufffdWhat I wanted to know was,\\nwhat he was going to do, and was he going to stay? \\ufffdJim got out his\\nhair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped\\nit on the floor. \\ufffdIt fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.\\n\\ufffdJim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.\\n\\ufffdJim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.\\n\\ufffdBut it warn\\'t no use; he said it wouldn\\'t talk. He said sometimes it\\nwouldn\\'t talk without money. \\ufffdI told him I had an old slick counterfeit\\nquarter that warn\\'t no good because the brass showed through the silver\\na little, and it wouldn\\'t pass nohow, even if the brass didn\\'t show,\\nbecause it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it\\nevery time. \\ufffd(I reckoned I wouldn\\'t say nothing about the dollar I got\\nfrom the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball\\nwould take it, because maybe it wouldn\\'t know the difference. \\ufffdJim smelt\\nit and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\\nwould think it was good. \\ufffdHe said he would split open a raw Irish potato\\nand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\\nmorning you couldn\\'t see no brass, and it wouldn\\'t feel greasy no more,\\nand so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.\\n\\ufffdWell, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.\\n\\nJim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened\\nagain. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. \\ufffdHe said it\\nwould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. \\ufffdI says, go on. \\ufffdSo the\\nhair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Yo\\' ole father doan\\' know yit what he\\'s a-gwyne to do. \\ufffdSometimes he\\nspec he\\'ll go \\'way, en den agin he spec he\\'ll stay. \\ufffdDe bes\\' way is to\\nres\\' easy en let de ole man take his own way. \\ufffdDey\\'s two angels hoverin\\'\\nroun\\' \\'bout him. \\ufffdOne uv \\'em is white en shiny, en t\\'other one is black.\\nDe white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail\\nin en bust it all up. \\ufffdA body can\\'t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch\\nhim at de las\\'. \\ufffdBut you is all right. \\ufffdYou gwyne to have considable\\ntrouble in yo\\' life, en considable joy. \\ufffdSometimes you gwyne to git\\nhurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you\\'s gwyne\\nto git well agin. \\ufffdDey\\'s two gals flyin\\' \\'bout you in yo\\' life. \\ufffdOne\\nuv \\'em\\'s light en t\\'other one is dark.

When I\\'d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack\\nwith his hand and knocked it across the house. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s so. \\ufffdYou can do it. \\ufffdI had my doubts when you told me. \\ufffdNow looky\\nhere; you stop that putting on frills. \\ufffdI won\\'t have it. \\ufffdI\\'ll lay for\\nyou, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I\\'ll tan you good.\\nFirst you know you\\'ll get religion, too. \\ufffdI never see such a son.\"\\n\\nHe took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s something they give me for learning my lessons good.\"\\n\\nHe tore it up, and says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give you something better--I\\'ll give you a cowhide.\"\\n\\nHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:\\n\\n\"_Ain\\'t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though? \\ufffdA bed; and bedclothes; and\\na look\\'n\\'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father\\ngot to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. \\ufffdI never see such a son. \\ufffdI\\nbet I\\'ll take some o\\' these frills out o\\' you before I\\'m done with you.\\nWhy, there ain\\'t no end to your airs--they say you\\'re rich. \\ufffdHey?--how\\'s\\nthat?\"\\n\\n\"They lie--that\\'s how.\"\\n\\n\"Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I\\'m a-standing about all I can\\nstand now--so don\\'t gimme no sass. \\ufffdI\\'ve been in town two days, and I\\nhain\\'t heard nothing but about you bein\\' rich. \\ufffdI heard about it\\naway down the river, too. \\ufffdThat\\'s why I come. \\ufffdYou git me that money\\nto-morrow--I want it.\"\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t got no money.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lie. \\ufffdJudge Thatcher\\'s got it. \\ufffdYou git it. \\ufffdI want it.\"\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t got no money, I tell you. \\ufffdYou ask Judge Thatcher; he\\'ll tell\\nyou the same.\"\\n\\n\"All right. \\ufffdI\\'ll ask him; and I\\'ll make him pungle, too, or I\\'ll know\\nthe reason why. \\ufffdSay, how much you got in your pocket? \\ufffdI want it.\"\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t got only a dollar, and I want that to--\"\\n\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it\\nout.\"\\n\\nHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was\\ngoing down town to get some whisky; said he hadn\\'t had a drink all day.\\nWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed\\nme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I\\nreckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me\\nto mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick\\nme if I didn\\'t drop that.\\n\\nNext day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher\\'s and bullyragged\\nhim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn\\'t, and then\\nhe swore he\\'d make the law force him.\\n\\nThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away\\nfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that\\nhad just come, and he didn\\'t know the old man; so he said courts mustn\\'t\\ninterfere and separate families if they could help it; said he\\'d druther\\nnot take a child away from its father. \\ufffdSo Judge Thatcher and the widow\\nhad to quit on the business.\\n\\nThat pleased the old man till he couldn\\'t rest. \\ufffdHe said he\\'d cowhide\\nme till I was black and blue if I didn\\'t raise some money for him. \\ufffdI\\nborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got\\ndrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying\\non; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;\\nthen they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed\\nhim again for a week. \\ufffdBut he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss\\nof his son, and he\\'d make it warm for _him_.\\n\\nWhen he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.\\nSo he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and\\nhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just\\nold pie to him, so to speak. \\ufffdAnd after supper he talked to him about\\ntemperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he\\'d been\\na fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over\\na new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn\\'t be ashamed of, and he hoped the\\njudge would help him and not look down on him. \\ufffdThe judge said he could\\nhug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap\\nsaid he\\'d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the\\njudge said he believed it. \\ufffdThe old man said that what a man wanted\\nthat was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried\\nagain. \\ufffdAnd when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his\\nhand, and says:\\n\\n\"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.\\nThere\\'s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain\\'t so no more; it\\'s\\nthe hand of a man that\\'s started in on a new life, and\\'ll die before\\nhe\\'ll go back. \\ufffdYou mark them words--don\\'t forget I said them. \\ufffdIt\\'s a\\nclean hand now; shake it--don\\'t be afeard.\"\\n\\nSo they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. \\ufffdThe\\njudge\\'s wife she kissed it. \\ufffdThen the old man he signed a pledge--made\\nhis mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something\\nlike that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was\\nthe spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and\\nclumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his\\nnew coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old\\ntime; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and\\nrolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most\\nfroze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. \\ufffdAnd when they come\\nto look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could\\nnavigate it.\\n\\nThe judge he felt kind of sore. \\ufffdHe said he reckoned a body could reform\\nthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn\\'t know no other way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nWELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went\\nfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he\\nwent for me, too, for not stopping school. \\ufffdHe catched me a couple of\\ntimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged\\nhim or outrun him most of the time. \\ufffdI didn\\'t want to go to school much\\nbefore, but I reckoned I\\'d go now to spite pap. \\ufffdThat law trial was a\\nslow business--appeared like they warn\\'t ever going to get started on it;\\nso every now and then I\\'d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge\\nfor him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. \\ufffdEvery time he got money he\\ngot drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and\\nevery time he raised Cain he got jailed. \\ufffdHe was just suited--this kind\\nof thing was right in his line.\\n\\nHe got to hanging around the widow\\'s too much and so she told him at\\nlast that if he didn\\'t quit using around there she would make trouble\\nfor him. Well, _wasn\\'t_ he mad? \\ufffdHe said he would show who was Huck\\nFinn\\'s boss. \\ufffdSo he watched out for me one day in the spring, and\\ncatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and\\ncrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\\'t\\nno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick\\nyou couldn\\'t find it if you didn\\'t know where it was.\\n\\nHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.\\nWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the\\nkey under his head nights. \\ufffdHe had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,\\nand we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. \\ufffdEvery little\\nwhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the\\nferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got\\ndrunk and had a good time, and licked me. \\ufffdThe widow she found out where\\nI was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but\\npap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\\'t long after that till I was\\nused to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.\\n\\nIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking\\nand fishing, and no books nor study. \\ufffdTwo months or more run along, and\\nmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\\'t see how I\\'d ever\\ngot to like it so well at the widow\\'s, where you had to wash, and eat on\\na plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever\\nbothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the\\ntime. \\ufffdI didn\\'t want to go back no more. \\ufffdI had stopped cussing, because\\nthe widow didn\\'t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn\\'t\\nno objections. \\ufffdIt was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it\\nall around.\\n\\nBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick\\'ry, and I couldn\\'t stand\\nit. I was all over welts. \\ufffdHe got to going away so much, too, and\\nlocking me in. \\ufffdOnce he locked me in and was gone three days. \\ufffdIt was\\ndreadful lonesome. \\ufffdI judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\\'t ever\\ngoing to get out any more. \\ufffdI was scared. \\ufffdI made up my mind I would fix\\nup some way to leave there. \\ufffdI had tried to get out of that cabin many\\na time, but I couldn\\'t find no way. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t a window to it big\\nenough for a dog to get through. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t get up the chimbly; it\\nwas too narrow. \\ufffdThe door was thick, solid oak slabs. \\ufffdPap was pretty\\ncareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;\\nI reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I\\nwas most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in\\nthe time. \\ufffdBut this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty\\nwood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the\\nclapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. \\ufffdThere was an\\nold horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin\\nbehind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and\\nputting the candle out. \\ufffdI got under the table and raised the blanket,\\nand went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough\\nto let me through. \\ufffdWell, it was a good long job, but I was getting\\ntowards the end of it when I heard pap\\'s gun in the woods. \\ufffdI got rid of\\nthe signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty\\nsoon pap come in.\\n\\nPap warn\\'t in a good humor--so he was his natural self. \\ufffdHe said he was\\ndown town, and everything was going wrong. \\ufffdHis lawyer said he reckoned\\nhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on\\nthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge\\nThatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there\\'d be\\nanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my\\nguardian, and they guessed it would win this time. \\ufffdThis shook me up\\nconsiderable, because I didn\\'t want to go back to the widow\\'s any more\\nand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. \\ufffdThen the old man\\ngot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,\\nand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\\'t skipped any,\\nand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,\\nincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didn\\'t know the names\\nof, and so called them what\\'s-his-name when he got to them, and went\\nright along with his cussing.\\n\\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. \\ufffdHe said he would watch\\nout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place\\nsix or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they\\ndropped and they couldn\\'t find me. \\ufffdThat made me pretty uneasy again,\\nbut only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\\'t stay on hand till he got\\nthat chance.\\n\\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had\\ngot. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,\\nammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two\\nnewspapers for wadding, besides some tow. \\ufffdI toted up a load, and went\\nback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. \\ufffdI thought it all\\nover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and\\ntake to the woods when I run away. \\ufffdI guessed I wouldn\\'t stay in one\\nplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and\\nhunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor\\nthe widow couldn\\'t ever find me any more. \\ufffdI judged I would saw out and\\nleave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. \\ufffdI\\ngot so full of it I didn\\'t notice how long I was staying till the old\\nman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\\n\\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. \\ufffdWhile\\nI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of\\nwarmed up, and went to ripping again. \\ufffdHe had been drunk over in town,\\nand laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. \\ufffdA body\\nwould a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud. \\ufffdWhenever his liquor\\nbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:\\n\\n\"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it\\'s like.\\nHere\\'s the law a-standing ready to take a man\\'s son away from him--a\\nman\\'s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety\\nand all the expense of raising. \\ufffdYes, just as that man has got that\\nson raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin\\' for\\n_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. \\ufffdAnd they call\\n_that_ govment! \\ufffdThat ain\\'t all, nuther. \\ufffdThe law backs that old Judge\\nThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o\\' my property. \\ufffdHere\\'s what\\nthe law does: \\ufffdThe law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and\\nup\\'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets\\nhim go round in clothes that ain\\'t fitten for a hog. They call that\\ngovment! \\ufffdA man can\\'t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes\\nI\\'ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,\\nand I _told_ \\'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. \\ufffdLots of \\'em\\nheard me, and can tell what I said. \\ufffdSays I, for two cents I\\'d leave the\\nblamed country and never come a-near it agin. \\ufffdThem\\'s the very words. \\ufffdI\\nsays look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the\\nrest of it goes down till it\\'s below my chin, and then it ain\\'t rightly\\na hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o\\'\\nstove-pipe. \\ufffdLook at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the\\nwealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. \\ufffdWhy, looky here.\\nThere was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as\\na white man. \\ufffdHe had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the\\nshiniest hat; and there ain\\'t a man in that town that\\'s got as fine\\nclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a\\nsilver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. \\ufffdAnd\\nwhat do you think? \\ufffdThey said he was a p\\'fessor in a college, and could\\ntalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. \\ufffdAnd that ain\\'t the\\nwust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. \\ufffdWell, that let me\\nout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? \\ufffdIt was \\'lection day,\\nand I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn\\'t too drunk to get\\nthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country where\\nthey\\'d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. \\ufffdI says I\\'ll never vote agin.\\n\\ufffdThem\\'s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may\\nrot for all me--I\\'ll never vote agin as long as I live. \\ufffdAnd to see the\\ncool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn\\'t a give me the road if I hadn\\'t\\nshoved him out o\\' the way. \\ufffdI says to the people, why ain\\'t this nigger\\nput up at auction and sold?--that\\'s what I want to know. \\ufffdAnd what do you\\nreckon they said? Why, they said he couldn\\'t be sold till he\\'d been in\\nthe State six months, and he hadn\\'t been there that long yet. \\ufffdThere,\\nnow--that\\'s a specimen. \\ufffdThey call that a govment that can\\'t sell a free\\nnigger till he\\'s been in the State six months. \\ufffdHere\\'s a govment that\\ncalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a\\ngovment, and yet\\'s got to set stock-still for six whole months before\\nit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free\\nnigger, and--\"\\n\\nPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was\\ntaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and\\nbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind\\nof language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give\\nthe tub some, too, all along, here and there. \\ufffdHe hopped around the\\ncabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding\\nfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his\\nleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. \\ufffdBut it\\nwarn\\'t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his\\ntoes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that\\nfairly made a body\\'s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and\\nrolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over\\nanything he had ever done previous. \\ufffdHe said so his own self afterwards.\\n\\ufffdHe had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid\\nover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.\\n\\nAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there\\nfor two drunks and one delirium tremens. \\ufffdThat was always his word. \\ufffdI\\njudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal\\nthe key, or saw myself out, one or t\\'other. \\ufffdHe drank and drank, and\\ntumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn\\'t run my way.\\n\\ufffdHe didn\\'t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. \\ufffdHe groaned and moaned and\\nthrashed around this way and that for a long time. \\ufffdAt last I got so\\nsleepy I couldn\\'t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I\\nknowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an\\nawful scream and I was up. \\ufffdThere was pap looking wild, and skipping\\naround every which way and yelling about snakes. \\ufffdHe said they was\\ncrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\\none had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn\\'t see no snakes. \\ufffdHe started\\nand run round and round the cabin, hollering \"Take him off! take him\\noff! he\\'s biting me on the neck!\" \\ufffdI never see a man look so wild in the\\neyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he\\nrolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,\\nand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and\\nsaying there was devils a-hold of him. \\ufffdHe wore out by and by, and laid\\nstill a while, moaning. \\ufffdThen he laid stiller, and didn\\'t make a sound.\\n\\ufffdI could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it\\nseemed terrible still. \\ufffdHe was laying over by the corner. By and by he\\nraised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. \\ufffdHe says,\\nvery low:\\n\\n\"Tramp--tramp--tramp; that\\'s the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they\\'re coming\\nafter me; but I won\\'t go. \\ufffdOh, they\\'re here! don\\'t touch me--don\\'t! hands\\noff--they\\'re cold; let go. \\ufffdOh, let a poor devil alone!\"\\n\\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\\nalone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\\nold pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. \\ufffdI could\\nhear him through the blanket.\\n\\nBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\\nsee me and went for me. \\ufffdHe chased me round and round the place with a\\nclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,\\nand then I couldn\\'t come for him no more. \\ufffdI begged, and told him I\\nwas only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and\\ncussed, and kept on chasing me up. \\ufffdOnce when I turned short and\\ndodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\\nshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick\\nas lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and\\ndropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a\\nminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would\\nsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.\\n\\nSo he dozed off pretty soon. \\ufffdBy and by I got the old split-bottom chair\\nand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the\\ngun. \\ufffdI slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I\\nlaid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down\\nbehind it to wait for him to stir. \\ufffdAnd how slow and still the time did\\ndrag along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\"GIT up! \\ufffdWhat you \\'bout?\"\\n\\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. \\ufffdIt\\nwas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. \\ufffdPap was standing over me\\nlooking sour and sick, too. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"What you doin\\' with this gun?\"\\n\\nI judged he didn\\'t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\\n\\n\"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you roust me out?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I tried to, but I couldn\\'t; I couldn\\'t budge you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, all right. \\ufffdDon\\'t stand there palavering all day, but out with\\nyou and see if there\\'s a fish on the lines for breakfast. \\ufffdI\\'ll be along\\nin a minute.\"\\n\\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. \\ufffdI noticed\\nsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of\\nbark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. \\ufffdI reckoned I would have\\ngreat times now if I was over at the town. \\ufffdThe June rise used to be\\nalways luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes\\ncordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs\\ntogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the\\nwood-yards and the sawmill.\\n\\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t\\'other one out\\nfor what the rise might fetch along. \\ufffdWell, all at once here comes a\\ncanoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding\\nhigh like a duck. \\ufffdI shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,\\nclothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. \\ufffdI just expected\\nthere\\'d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\\nto fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they\\'d\\nraise up and laugh at him. \\ufffdBut it warn\\'t so this time. \\ufffdIt was a\\ndrift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. \\ufffdThinks\\nI, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she\\'s worth ten dollars.\\n\\ufffdBut when I got to shore pap wasn\\'t in sight yet, and as I was running\\nher into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and\\nwillows, I struck another idea: \\ufffdI judged I\\'d hide her good, and then,\\n\\'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\\'d go down the river\\nabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\\nrough time tramping on foot.\\n\\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\\ncoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around\\na bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just\\ndrawing a bead on a bird with his gun. \\ufffdSo he hadn\\'t seen anything.\\n\\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a \"trot\" line. \\ufffdHe abused\\nme a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and\\nthat was what made me so long. \\ufffdI knowed he would see I was wet, and\\nthen he would be asking questions. \\ufffdWe got five catfish off the lines\\nand went home.\\n\\nWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\\nwore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\\nand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing\\nthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you\\nsee, all kinds of things might happen. \\ufffdWell, I didn\\'t see no way for a\\nwhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of\\nwater, and he says:\\n\\n\"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\\nhear? That man warn\\'t here for no good. \\ufffdI\\'d a shot him. \\ufffdNext time you\\nroust me out, you hear?\"\\n\\nThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been\\nsaying give me the very idea I wanted. \\ufffdI says to myself, I can fix it\\nnow so nobody won\\'t think of following me.\\n\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. \\ufffdThe\\nriver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the\\nrise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.\\n\\ufffdWe went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. \\ufffdThen we had dinner.\\nAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\\nmore stuff; but that warn\\'t pap\\'s style. \\ufffdNine logs was enough for one\\ntime; he must shove right over to town and sell. \\ufffdSo he locked me in and\\ntook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\\n\\ufffdI judged he wouldn\\'t come back that night. \\ufffdI waited till I reckoned he\\nhad got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that\\nlog again. \\ufffdBefore he was t\\'other side of the river I was out of the\\nhole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\\n\\nI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\\nshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\\nwith the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. \\ufffdI took all the coffee and\\nsugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\\nbucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\\nblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. \\ufffdI took fish-lines and\\nmatches and other things--everything that was worth a cent. \\ufffdI cleaned\\nout the place. \\ufffdI wanted an axe, but there wasn\\'t any, only the one out\\nat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. \\ufffdI fetched\\nout the gun, and now I was done.\\n\\nI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\\nout so many things. \\ufffdSo I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\\nby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\\nsawdust. \\ufffdThen I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\\nrocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\\nat that place and didn\\'t quite touch ground. \\ufffdIf you stood four or five\\nfoot away and didn\\'t know it was sawed, you wouldn\\'t never notice\\nit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn\\'t likely\\nanybody would go fooling around there.\\n\\nIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn\\'t left a track. \\ufffdI\\nfollowed around to see. \\ufffdI stood on the bank and looked out over the\\nriver. \\ufffdAll safe. \\ufffdSo I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\\nand was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\\nwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\\nfarms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\\n\\nI took the axe and smashed in the door. \\ufffdI beat it and hacked it\\nconsiderable a-doing it. \\ufffdI fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\\nto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\\non the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\\nand no boards. \\ufffdWell, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\\nin it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\\nthe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\\ndown it sunk, out of sight. \\ufffdYou could easy see that something had been\\ndragged over the ground. \\ufffdI did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\\nwould take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\\ntouches. \\ufffdNobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\\nthat.\\n\\nWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\\nstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. \\ufffdThen I\\ntook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\\'t\\ndrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\\nthe river. \\ufffdNow I thought of something else. \\ufffdSo I went and got the bag\\nof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\\n\\ufffdI took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\\nbottom of it with the saw, for there warn\\'t no knives and forks on the\\nplace--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. \\ufffdThen\\nI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\\nthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\\nand full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season. \\ufffdThere\\nwas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\\nmiles away, I don\\'t know where, but it didn\\'t go to the river. \\ufffdThe meal\\nsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. \\ufffdI dropped\\npap\\'s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\\naccident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\\nwouldn\\'t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\\n\\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\\nwillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. \\ufffdI\\nmade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\\ndown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. \\ufffdI says to myself,\\nthey\\'ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\\ndrag the river for me. \\ufffdAnd they\\'ll follow that meal track to the lake\\nand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\\nthat killed me and took the things. \\ufffdThey won\\'t ever hunt the river for\\nanything but my dead carcass. They\\'ll soon get tired of that, and won\\'t\\nbother no more about me. \\ufffdAll right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\\nJackson\\'s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\\nand nobody ever comes there. \\ufffdAnd then I can paddle over to town nights,\\nand slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\\'s Island\\'s the\\nplace.\\n\\nI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. \\ufffdWhen\\nI woke up I didn\\'t know where I was for a minute. \\ufffdI set up and looked\\naround, a little scared. \\ufffdThen I remembered. \\ufffdThe river looked miles and\\nmiles across. \\ufffdThe moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\\nthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\\nshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\\nYou know what I mean--I don\\'t know the words to put it in.\\n\\nI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\\nwhen I heard a sound away over the water. \\ufffdI listened. \\ufffdPretty soon I\\nmade it out. \\ufffdIt was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\\noars working in rowlocks when it\\'s a still night. \\ufffdI peeped out through\\nthe willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\\n\\ufffdI couldn\\'t tell how many was in it. \\ufffdIt kept a-coming, and when it was\\nabreast of me I see there warn\\'t but one man in it. \\ufffdThink\\'s I, maybe\\nit\\'s pap, though I warn\\'t expecting him. \\ufffdHe dropped below me with the\\ncurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\\nand he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\\n\\ufffdWell, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\\noars.\\n\\nI didn\\'t lose no time. \\ufffdThe next minute I was a-spinning down stream\\nsoft but quick in the shade of the bank. \\ufffdI made two mile and a half,\\nand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\\nthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\\npeople might see me and hail me. \\ufffdI got out amongst the driftwood, and\\nthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\\n\\n\\ufffdI laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\\naway into the sky; not a cloud in it. \\ufffdThe sky looks ever so deep when\\nyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\\n\\ufffdAnd how far a body can hear on the water such nights! \\ufffdI heard people\\ntalking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\\nof it. \\ufffdOne man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\\nnights now. \\ufffdT\\'other one said _this_ warn\\'t one of the short ones, he\\nreckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\\nlaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\\nlaughed, but he didn\\'t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\\nlet him alone. \\ufffdThe first fellow said he \\'lowed to tell it to his\\nold woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\\'t\\nnothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\\nwas nearly three o\\'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\\'t wait more than\\nabout a week longer. \\ufffdAfter that the talk got further and further away,\\nand I couldn\\'t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\\nand now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\\n\\nI was away below the ferry now. \\ufffdI rose up, and there was Jackson\\'s\\nIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\\nstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\\na steamboat without any lights. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t any signs of the bar at\\nthe head--it was all under water now.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take me long to get there. \\ufffdI shot past the head at a ripping\\nrate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\\nlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore. \\ufffdI run the canoe into\\na deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\\nbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\\nfrom the outside.\\n\\nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\\nout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\\nthree mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. \\ufffdA\\nmonstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\\nwith a lantern in the middle of it. \\ufffdI watched it come creeping down,\\nand when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern\\noars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\" \\ufffdI heard that just as plain\\nas if the man was by my side.\\n\\nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\\nlaid down for a nap before breakfast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nTHE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\\no\\'clock. \\ufffdI laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\\nthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. \\ufffdI\\ncould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\\nall about, and gloomy in there amongst them. \\ufffdThere was freckled places\\non the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\\nfreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\\nbreeze up there. \\ufffdA couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\\nvery friendly.\\n\\nI was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn\\'t want to get up and cook\\nbreakfast. \\ufffdWell, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\\nsound of \"boom!\" away up the river. \\ufffdI rouses up, and rests on my elbow\\nand listens; pretty soon I hears it again. \\ufffdI hopped up, and went and\\nlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\\non the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. \\ufffdAnd there was the\\nferryboat full of people floating along down. \\ufffdI knowed what was the\\nmatter now. \\ufffd\"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\\'s\\nside. \\ufffdYou see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\\ncarcass come to the top.\\n\\nI was pretty hungry, but it warn\\'t going to do for me to start a fire,\\nbecause they might see the smoke. \\ufffdSo I set there and watched the\\ncannon-smoke and listened to the boom. \\ufffdThe river was a mile wide there,\\nand it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\\nenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\\neat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\\nloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\\ndrownded carcass and stop there. \\ufffdSo, says I, I\\'ll keep a lookout, and\\nif any of them\\'s floating around after me I\\'ll give them a show. \\ufffdI\\nchanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\\nhave, and I warn\\'t disappointed. \\ufffdA big double loaf come along, and I\\nmost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\\nfurther. \\ufffdOf course I was where the current set in the closest to the\\nshore--I knowed enough for that. \\ufffdBut by and by along comes another one,\\nand this time I won. \\ufffdI took out the plug and shook out the little dab\\nof quicksilver, and set my teeth in. \\ufffdIt was \"baker\\'s bread\"--what the\\nquality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\\n\\nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\\nthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. \\ufffdAnd\\nthen something struck me. \\ufffdI says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\\nor somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\\nand done it. \\ufffdSo there ain\\'t no doubt but there is something in that\\nthing--that is, there\\'s something in it when a body like the widow or the\\nparson prays, but it don\\'t work for me, and I reckon it don\\'t work for\\nonly just the right kind.\\n\\nI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. \\ufffdThe\\nferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I\\'d have a chance\\nto see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\\nclose, where the bread did. \\ufffdWhen she\\'d got pretty well along down\\ntowards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\\nand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. \\ufffdWhere\\nthe log forked I could peep through.\\n\\nBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\\na run out a plank and walked ashore. \\ufffdMost everybody was on the boat.\\n\\ufffdPap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\\nSawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\\n\\ufffdEverybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\\'s\\nwashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\\'s edge. \\ufffdI\\nhope so, anyway.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t hope so. \\ufffdThey all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\\nin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. \\ufffdI could see\\nthem first-rate, but they couldn\\'t see me. \\ufffdThen the captain sung out:\\n\\n\"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\\nit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\\nI judged I was gone. \\ufffdIf they\\'d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\\'d\\na got the corpse they was after. \\ufffdWell, I see I warn\\'t hurt, thanks to\\ngoodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\\nof the island. \\ufffdI could hear the booming now and then, further and\\nfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn\\'t hear it no more.\\n\\ufffdThe island was three mile long. \\ufffdI judged they had got to the foot, and\\nwas giving it up. \\ufffdBut they didn\\'t yet a while. \\ufffdThey turned around\\nthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\\nunder steam, and booming once in a while as they went. \\ufffdI crossed over\\nto that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\\nisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\\nwent home to the town.\\n\\nI knowed I was all right now. \\ufffdNobody else would come a-hunting after\\nme. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\\nwoods. \\ufffdI made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\\nunder so the rain couldn\\'t get at them. \\ufffdI catched a catfish and haggled\\nhim open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\\nsupper. \\ufffdThen I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\\n\\nWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\\nsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\\non the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\\nstars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\\nthere ain\\'t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\\ncan\\'t stay so, you soon get over it.\\n\\nAnd so for three days and nights. \\ufffdNo difference--just the same thing.\\nBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island. \\ufffdI was\\nboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\\nall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. \\ufffdI found plenty\\nstrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\\nrazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. \\ufffdThey\\nwould all come handy by and by, I judged.\\n\\nWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\\'t\\nfar from the foot of the island. \\ufffdI had my gun along, but I hadn\\'t shot\\nnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\\nhome. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\\nand it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\\nit, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\\nbounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\\n\\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs. \\ufffdI never waited for to look\\nfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\\nfast as ever I could. \\ufffdEvery now and then I stopped a second amongst the\\nthick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn\\'t hear\\nnothing else. \\ufffdI slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\\nand so on, and so on. \\ufffdIf I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\\non a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\\nbreaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\\n\\nWhen I got to camp I warn\\'t feeling very brash, there warn\\'t much sand\\nin my craw; but I says, this ain\\'t no time to be fooling around. \\ufffdSo I\\ngot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\\nand I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\\nold last year\\'s camp, and then clumb a tree.\\n\\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\\'t see nothing,\\nI didn\\'t hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\\nthousand things. \\ufffdWell, I couldn\\'t stay up there forever; so at last I\\ngot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\\ntime. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\\nbreakfast.\\n\\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. \\ufffdSo when it was good\\nand dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\\nIllinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. \\ufffdI went out in the woods and\\ncooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\\nall night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\\nto myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\\'s voices. \\ufffdI got\\neverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\\nthrough the woods to see what I could find out. \\ufffdI hadn\\'t got far when I\\nhear a man say:\\n\\n\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\\nbeat out. \\ufffdLet\\'s look around.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. \\ufffdI tied up in the\\nold place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\\n\\nI didn\\'t sleep much. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t, somehow, for thinking. \\ufffdAnd every time\\nI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. \\ufffdSo the sleep didn\\'t\\ndo me no good. \\ufffdBy and by I says to myself, I can\\'t live this way; I\\'m\\na-going to find out who it is that\\'s here on the island with me; I\\'ll\\nfind it out or bust. \\ufffdWell, I felt better right off.\\n\\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\\nthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. \\ufffdThe moon was\\nshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\\n\\ufffdI poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\\nasleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. \\ufffdA\\nlittle ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\\nthe night was about done. \\ufffdI give her a turn with the paddle and brung\\nher nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\\nof the woods. \\ufffdI sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\\nleaves. \\ufffdI see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\\nthe river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\\nand knowed the day was coming. \\ufffdSo I took my gun and slipped off towards\\nwhere I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\\nto listen. \\ufffdBut I hadn\\'t no luck somehow; I couldn\\'t seem to find the\\nplace. \\ufffdBut by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\\nthrough the trees. \\ufffdI went for it, cautious and slow. \\ufffdBy and by I was\\nclose enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. \\ufffdIt\\nmost give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\\nhead was nearly in the fire. \\ufffdI set there behind a clump of bushes, in\\nabout six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. \\ufffdIt was getting\\ngray daylight now. \\ufffdPretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\\noff the blanket, and it was Miss Watson\\'s Jim! \\ufffdI bet I was glad to see\\nhim. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out.\\n\\nHe bounced up and stared at me wild. \\ufffdThen he drops down on his knees,\\nand puts his hands together and says:\\n\\n\"Doan\\' hurt me--don\\'t! \\ufffdI hain\\'t ever done no harm to a ghos\\'. \\ufffdI alwuz\\nliked dead people, en done all I could for \\'em. \\ufffdYou go en git in de\\nriver agin, whah you b\\'longs, en doan\\' do nuffn to Ole Jim, \\'at \\'uz\\nawluz yo\\' fren\\'.\"\\n\\nWell, I warn\\'t long making him understand I warn\\'t dead. \\ufffdI was ever so\\nglad to see Jim. \\ufffdI warn\\'t lonesome now. \\ufffdI told him I warn\\'t afraid of\\n_him_ telling the people where I was. \\ufffdI talked along, but he only set\\nthere and looked at me; never said nothing. \\ufffdThen I says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s good daylight. \\ufffdLe\\'s get breakfast. \\ufffdMake up your camp fire good.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s de use er makin\\' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\\ntruck? But you got a gun, hain\\'t you? \\ufffdDen we kin git sumfn better den\\nstrawbries.\"\\n\\n\"Strawberries and such truck,\" I says. \\ufffd\"Is that what you live on?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\' git nuffn else,\" he says.\\n\\n\"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"I come heah de night arter you\\'s killed.\"\\n\\n\"What, all that time?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--indeedy.\"\\n\\n\"And ain\\'t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah--nuffn else.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you must be most starved, ain\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I reck\\'n I could eat a hoss. \\ufffdI think I could. How long you ben on de\\nislan\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Since the night I got killed.\"\\n\\n\"No! \\ufffdW\\'y, what has you lived on? \\ufffdBut you got a gun. \\ufffdOh, yes, you got\\na gun. \\ufffdDat\\'s good. \\ufffdNow you kill sumfn en I\\'ll make up de fire.\"\\n\\nSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\\na grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\\ncoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\\nnigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\\nwith witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\\nwith his knife, and fried him.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\\nJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. \\ufffdThen\\nwhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. \\ufffdBy and by\\nJim says:\\n\\n\"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat \\'uz killed in dat shanty ef it\\nwarn\\'t you?\"\\n\\nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. \\ufffdHe said Tom\\nSawyer couldn\\'t get up no better plan than what I had. \\ufffdThen I says:\\n\\n\"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how\\'d you get here?\"\\n\\nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn\\'t say nothing for a minute. \\ufffdThen he\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Maybe I better not tell.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Well, dey\\'s reasons. \\ufffdBut you wouldn\\' tell on me ef I uz to tell you,\\nwould you, Huck?\"\\n\\n\"Blamed if I would, Jim.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I b\\'lieve you, Huck. \\ufffdI--_I run off_.\"\\n\\n\"Jim!\"\\n\\n\"But mind, you said you wouldn\\' tell--you know you said you wouldn\\' tell,\\nHuck.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I did. \\ufffdI said I wouldn\\'t, and I\\'ll stick to it. \\ufffdHonest _injun_,\\nI will. \\ufffdPeople would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for\\nkeeping mum--but that don\\'t make no difference. \\ufffdI ain\\'t a-going to tell,\\nand I ain\\'t a-going back there, anyways. \\ufffdSo, now, le\\'s know all about\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you see, it \\'uz dis way. \\ufffdOle missus--dat\\'s Miss Watson--she pecks\\non me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she\\nwouldn\\' sell me down to Orleans. \\ufffdBut I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader\\nroun\\' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. \\ufffdWell, one\\nnight I creeps to de do\\' pooty late, en de do\\' warn\\'t quite shet, en I\\nhear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but\\nshe didn\\' want to, but she could git eight hund\\'d dollars for me, en it\\n\\'uz sich a big stack o\\' money she couldn\\' resis\\'. \\ufffdDe widder she try to\\ngit her to say she wouldn\\' do it, but I never waited to hear de res\\'. \\ufffdI\\nlit out mighty quick, I tell you.\\n\\n\"I tuck out en shin down de hill, en \\'spec to steal a skift \\'long de\\nsho\\' som\\'ers \\'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid\\nin de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to\\ngo \\'way.

Did you hear \\'em shooting the cannon?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. \\ufffdI knowed dey was arter you. \\ufffdI see um go by heah--watched um\\nthoo de bushes.\"\\n\\nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and\\nlighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. \\ufffdHe said it was\\na sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the\\nsame way when young birds done it. \\ufffdI was going to catch some of them,\\nbut Jim wouldn\\'t let me. \\ufffdHe said it was death. \\ufffdHe said his father laid\\nmighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny\\nsaid his father would die, and he did.\\n\\nAnd Jim said you mustn\\'t count the things you are going to cook for\\ndinner, because that would bring bad luck. \\ufffdThe same if you shook the\\ntable-cloth after sundown. \\ufffdAnd he said if a man owned a beehive\\nand that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next\\nmorning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.\\n\\ufffdJim said bees wouldn\\'t sting idiots; but I didn\\'t believe that, because\\nI had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn\\'t sting me.\\n\\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. \\ufffdJim\\nknowed all kinds of signs. \\ufffdHe said he knowed most everything. \\ufffdI said\\nit looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked\\nhim if there warn\\'t any good-luck signs. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Mighty few--an\\' _dey_ ain\\'t no use to a body. \\ufffdWhat you want to know\\nwhen good luck\\'s a-comin\\' for? \\ufffdWant to keep it off?\" \\ufffdAnd he said: \\ufffd\"Ef\\nyou\\'s got hairy arms en a hairy breas\\', it\\'s a sign dat you\\'s agwyne\\nto be rich. Well, dey\\'s some use in a sign like dat, \\'kase it\\'s so fur\\nahead. You see, maybe you\\'s got to be po\\' a long time fust, en so you\\nmight git discourage\\' en kill yo\\'sef \\'f you didn\\' know by de sign dat\\nyou gwyne to be rich bymeby.\"\\n\\n\"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s de use to ax dat question? \\ufffdDon\\'t you see I has?\"\\n\\n\"Well, are you rich?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. \\ufffdWunst I had\\nfoteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat\\'n\\', en got busted out.\"\\n\\n\"What did you speculate in, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Well, fust I tackled stock.\"\\n\\n\"What kind of stock?\"\\n\\n\"Why, live stock--cattle, you know. \\ufffdI put ten dollars in a cow. \\ufffdBut\\nI ain\\' gwyne to resk no mo\\' money in stock. \\ufffdDe cow up \\'n\\' died on my\\nhan\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"So you lost the ten dollars.\"\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t lose it all. \\ufffdI on\\'y los\\' \\'bout nine of it. \\ufffdI sole de\\nhide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.\"\\n\\n\"You had five dollars and ten cents left. \\ufffdDid you speculate any more?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. \\ufffdYou know that one-laigged nigger dat b\\'longs to old Misto\\nBradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar\\nwould git fo\\' dollars mo\\' at de en\\' er de year. \\ufffdWell, all de niggers\\nwent in, but dey didn\\'t have much. \\ufffdI wuz de on\\'y one dat had much. \\ufffdSo\\nI stuck out for mo\\' dan fo\\' dollars, en I said \\'f I didn\\' git it I\\'d\\nstart a bank mysef. Well, o\\' course dat nigger want\\' to keep me out er\\nde business, bekase he says dey warn\\'t business \\'nough for two banks, so\\nhe say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en\\'\\ner de year.\\n\\n\"So I done it. \\ufffdDen I reck\\'n\\'d I\\'d inves\\' de thirty-five dollars right\\noff en keep things a-movin\\'. \\ufffdDey wuz a nigger name\\' Bob, dat had\\nketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn\\' know it; en I bought it off\\'n\\nhim en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en\\' er de\\nyear come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de\\none-laigged nigger say de bank\\'s busted. \\ufffdSo dey didn\\' none uv us git no\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I \\'uz gwyne to spen\\' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me\\nto give it to a nigger name\\' Balum--Balum\\'s Ass dey call him for short;\\nhe\\'s one er dem chuckleheads, you know. \\ufffdBut he\\'s lucky, dey say, en I\\nsee I warn\\'t lucky. \\ufffdDe dream say let Balum inves\\' de ten cents en he\\'d\\nmake a raise for me. \\ufffdWell, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in\\nchurch he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po\\' len\\' to de\\nLord, en boun\\' to git his money back a hund\\'d times. \\ufffdSo Balum he tuck\\nen give de ten cents to de po\\', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to\\ncome of it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what did come of it, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Nuffn never come of it. \\ufffdI couldn\\' manage to k\\'leck dat money no way;\\nen Balum he couldn\\'. \\ufffdI ain\\' gwyne to len\\' no mo\\' money \\'dout I see de\\nsecurity. \\ufffdBoun\\' to git yo\\' money back a hund\\'d times, de preacher says!\\nEf I could git de ten _cents_ back, I\\'d call it squah, en be glad er de\\nchanst.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s all right anyway, Jim, long as you\\'re going to be rich again\\nsome time or other.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; en I\\'s rich now, come to look at it. \\ufffdI owns mysef, en I\\'s wuth\\neight hund\\'d dollars. \\ufffdI wisht I had de money, I wouldn\\' want no mo\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\\nthat I\\'d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\\nbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\\nwide.\\n\\nThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\\nhigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\\nthe bushes so thick. \\ufffdWe tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\\nand by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\\nside towards Illinois. \\ufffdThe cavern was as big as two or three rooms\\nbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. \\ufffdIt was cool in\\nthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\\ndidn\\'t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\\n\\nJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\\nin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\\nand they would never find us without dogs. \\ufffdAnd, besides, he said them\\nlittle birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\\nget wet?\\n\\nSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\\nand lugged all the traps up there. \\ufffdThen we hunted up a place close by\\nto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. \\ufffdWe took some fish off\\nof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\\n\\nThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\\nside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\\ngood place to build a fire on. \\ufffdSo we built it there and cooked dinner.\\n\\nWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\\nWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. \\ufffdPretty\\nsoon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\\nright about it. \\ufffdDirectly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\\ntoo, and I never see the wind blow so. \\ufffdIt was one of these regular\\nsummer storms. \\ufffdIt would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\\noutside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\\nthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\\ncome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\\npale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\\nfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\\nwas just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\\nblackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you\\'d have a little\\nglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\\nhundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\\nin a second, and now you\\'d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\\nand then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\\nunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where\\nit\\'s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\\n\\n\"Jim, this is nice,\" I says. \\ufffd\"I wouldn\\'t want to be nowhere else but\\nhere. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you wouldn\\'t a ben here \\'f it hadn\\'t a ben for Jim. \\ufffdYou\\'d a ben\\ndown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn\\' mos\\' drownded, too;\\ndat you would, honey. \\ufffdChickens knows when it\\'s gwyne to rain, en so do\\nde birds, chile.\"\\n\\nThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\\nlast it was over the banks. \\ufffdThe water was three or four foot deep on\\nthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. \\ufffdOn that side\\nit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\\nold distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a\\nwall of high bluffs.\\n\\nDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\\nand shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. \\ufffdWe\\nwent winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\\nso thick we had to back away and go some other way. \\ufffdWell, on every old\\nbroken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\\nwhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\\naccount of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\\nhand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\\nslide off in the water. \\ufffdThe ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\\nWe could a had pets enough if we\\'d wanted them.\\n\\nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\\nIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\\nthe top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor. \\ufffdWe\\ncould see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\\nwe didn\\'t show ourselves in daylight.\\n\\nAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\\ndaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. \\ufffdShe was\\na two-story, and tilted over considerable. \\ufffdWe paddled out and got\\naboard--clumb in at an upstairs window. \\ufffdBut it was too dark to see yet,\\nso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\\n\\nThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. \\ufffdThen\\nwe looked in at the window. \\ufffdWe could make out a bed, and a table, and\\ntwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\\nwas clothes hanging against the wall. \\ufffdThere was something laying on the\\nfloor in the far corner that looked like a man. \\ufffdSo Jim says:\\n\\n\"Hello, you!\"\\n\\nBut it didn\\'t budge. \\ufffdSo I hollered again, and then Jim says:\\n\\n\"De man ain\\'t asleep--he\\'s dead. \\ufffdYou hold still--I\\'ll go en see.\"\\n\\nHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s a dead man. \\ufffdYes, indeedy; naked, too. \\ufffdHe\\'s ben shot in de back.\\nI reck\\'n he\\'s ben dead two er three days. \\ufffdCome in, Huck, but doan\\' look\\nat his face--it\\'s too gashly.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t look at him at all. \\ufffdJim throwed some old rags over him, but\\nhe needn\\'t done it; I didn\\'t want to see him. \\ufffdThere was heaps of old\\ngreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\\nand a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\\nwas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\\n\\ufffdThere was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\\nwomen\\'s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men\\'s clothing,\\ntoo. \\ufffdWe put the lot into the canoe--it might come good. \\ufffdThere was a\\nboy\\'s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. \\ufffdAnd there\\nwas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\\nbaby to suck. \\ufffdWe would a took the bottle, but it was broke. \\ufffdThere was\\na seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. \\ufffdThey\\nstood open, but there warn\\'t nothing left in them that was any account.\\n\\ufffdThe way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a\\nhurry, and warn\\'t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\\n\\nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\\na bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\\ncandles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\\nold bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\\nbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\\nand some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\\nmonstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\\nand a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\\'t have no label\\non them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\\nand Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. \\ufffdThe straps\\nwas broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\\nit was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn\\'t find\\nthe other one, though we hunted all around.\\n\\nAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul. \\ufffdWhen we was ready to\\nshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\\nbroad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\\nquilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\\nways off. \\ufffdI paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most\\na half a mile doing it. \\ufffdI crept up the dead water under the bank, and\\nhadn\\'t no accidents and didn\\'t see nobody. \\ufffdWe got home all safe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nAFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he\\ncome to be killed, but Jim didn\\'t want to. \\ufffdHe said it would fetch bad\\nluck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\\'nt us; he said a man\\nthat warn\\'t buried was more likely to go a-ha\\'nting around than one\\nthat was planted and comfortable. \\ufffdThat sounded pretty reasonable, so\\nI didn\\'t say no more; but I couldn\\'t keep from studying over it and\\nwishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.\\n\\nWe rummaged the clothes we\\'d got, and found eight dollars in silver\\nsewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. \\ufffdJim said he reckoned\\nthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they\\'d a knowed the\\nmoney was there they wouldn\\'t a left it. \\ufffdI said I reckoned they killed\\nhim, too; but Jim didn\\'t want to talk about that. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Now you think it\\'s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the\\nsnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?\\nYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin\\nwith my hands. \\ufffdWell, here\\'s your bad luck! \\ufffdWe\\'ve raked in all this\\ntruck and eight dollars besides. \\ufffdI wish we could have some bad luck\\nlike this every day, Jim.\"\\n\\n\"Never you mind, honey, never you mind. \\ufffdDon\\'t you git too peart. \\ufffdIt\\'s\\na-comin\\'. \\ufffdMind I tell you, it\\'s a-comin\\'.\"\\n\\nIt did come, too. \\ufffdIt was a Tuesday that we had that talk. \\ufffdWell, after\\ndinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the\\nridge, and got out of tobacco. \\ufffdI went to the cavern to get some, and\\nfound a rattlesnake in there. \\ufffdI killed him, and curled him up on the\\nfoot of Jim\\'s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there\\'d be some fun\\nwhen Jim found him there. \\ufffdWell, by night I forgot all about the snake,\\nand when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light\\nthe snake\\'s mate was there, and bit him.\\n\\nHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the\\nvarmint curled up and ready for another spring. \\ufffdI laid him out in a\\nsecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap\\'s whisky-jug and begun to pour\\nit down.\\n\\nHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. \\ufffdThat all\\ncomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave\\na dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. \\ufffdJim told\\nme to chop off the snake\\'s head and throw it away, and then skin the\\nbody and roast a piece of it. \\ufffdI done it, and he eat it and said it\\nwould help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\\nhis wrist, too. \\ufffdHe said that that would help. \\ufffdThen I slid out quiet\\nand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\\'t going\\nto let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.\\n\\nJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his\\nhead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he\\nwent to sucking at the jug again. \\ufffdHis foot swelled up pretty big, and\\nso did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged\\nhe was all right; but I\\'d druther been bit with a snake than pap\\'s\\nwhisky.\\n\\nJim was laid up for four days and nights. \\ufffdThen the swelling was all\\ngone and he was around again. \\ufffdI made up my mind I wouldn\\'t ever take\\na-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come\\nof it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. \\ufffdAnd he said\\nthat handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\\'t\\ngot to the end of it yet. \\ufffdHe said he druther see the new moon over his\\nleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin\\nin his hand. \\ufffdWell, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\\'ve\\nalways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is\\none of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. \\ufffdOld Hank\\nBunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he\\ngot drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so\\nthat he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him\\nedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so\\nthey say, but I didn\\'t see it. \\ufffdPap told me. \\ufffdBut anyway it all come of\\nlooking at the moon that way, like a fool.\\n\\nWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\\nagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\\nhooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\\nas big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\\nhundred pounds. We couldn\\'t handle him, of course; he would a flung us\\ninto Illinois. \\ufffdWe just set there and watched him rip and tear around\\ntill he drownded. \\ufffdWe found a brass button in his stomach and a round\\nball, and lots of rubbage. \\ufffdWe split the ball open with the hatchet,\\nand there was a spool in it. \\ufffdJim said he\\'d had it there a long time, to\\ncoat it over so and make a ball of it. \\ufffdIt was as big a fish as was ever\\ncatched in the Mississippi, I reckon. \\ufffdJim said he hadn\\'t ever seen\\na bigger one. \\ufffdHe would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\\n\\ufffdThey peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\\nthere; everybody buys some of him; his meat\\'s as white as snow and makes\\na good fry.\\n\\nNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\\nstirring up some way. \\ufffdI said I reckoned I would slip over the river and\\nfind out what was going on. \\ufffdJim liked that notion; but he said I\\nmust go in the dark and look sharp. \\ufffdThen he studied it over and said,\\ncouldn\\'t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\\n\\ufffdThat was a good notion, too. \\ufffdSo we shortened up one of the calico\\ngowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. \\ufffdJim\\nhitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. \\ufffdI put on the\\nsun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\\nand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. \\ufffdJim said\\nnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. \\ufffdI practiced around\\nall day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\\nwell in them, only Jim said I didn\\'t walk like a girl; and he said\\nI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. \\ufffdI took\\nnotice, and done better.\\n\\nI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\\n\\nI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and\\nthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. \\ufffdI\\ntied up and started along the bank. \\ufffdThere was a light burning in a\\nlittle shanty that hadn\\'t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\\nwho had took up quarters there. \\ufffdI slipped up and peeped in at the\\nwindow. \\ufffdThere was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by\\na candle that was on a pine table. \\ufffdI didn\\'t know her face; she was a\\nstranger, for you couldn\\'t start a face in that town that I didn\\'t know.\\n\\ufffdNow this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had\\ncome; people might know my voice and find me out. \\ufffdBut if this woman had\\nbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to\\nknow; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\\'t forget I\\nwas a girl.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\"COME in,\" says the woman, and I did. \\ufffdShe says: \\ufffd\"Take a cheer.\"\\n\\nI done it. \\ufffdShe looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:\\n\\n\"What might your name be?\"\\n\\n\"Sarah Williams.\"\\n\\n\"Where \\'bouts do you live? \\ufffdIn this neighborhood?\\'\\n\\n\"No\\'m. \\ufffdIn Hookerville, seven mile below. \\ufffdI\\'ve walked all the way and\\nI\\'m all tired out.\"\\n\\n\"Hungry, too, I reckon. \\ufffdI\\'ll find you something.\"\\n\\n\"No\\'m, I ain\\'t hungry. \\ufffdI was so hungry I had to stop two miles below\\nhere at a farm; so I ain\\'t hungry no more. \\ufffdIt\\'s what makes me so late.\\nMy mother\\'s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to\\ntell my uncle Abner Moore. \\ufffdHe lives at the upper end of the town, she\\nsays. \\ufffdI hain\\'t ever been here before. \\ufffdDo you know him?\"\\n\\n\"No; but I don\\'t know everybody yet. \\ufffdI haven\\'t lived here quite two\\nweeks. It\\'s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. \\ufffdYou\\nbetter stay here all night. \\ufffdTake off your bonnet.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I says; \"I\\'ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. \\ufffdI ain\\'t afeared\\nof the dark.\"\\n\\nShe said she wouldn\\'t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in\\nby and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she\\'d send him along with me.\\nThen she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up\\nthe river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better\\noff they used to was, and how they didn\\'t know but they\\'d made a mistake\\ncoming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,\\ntill I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what\\nwas going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the\\nmurder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.\\n\\ufffdShe told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only\\nshe got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what\\na hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. \\ufffdI\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Who done it? \\ufffdWe\\'ve heard considerable about these goings on down in\\nHookerville, but we don\\'t know who \\'twas that killed Huck Finn.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon there\\'s a right smart chance of people _here_ that\\'d\\nlike to know who killed him. \\ufffdSome think old Finn done it himself.\"\\n\\n\"No--is that so?\"\\n\\n\"Most everybody thought it at first. \\ufffdHe\\'ll never know how nigh he come\\nto getting lynched. \\ufffdBut before night they changed around and judged it\\nwas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.\"\\n\\n\"Why _he_--\"\\n\\nI stopped. \\ufffdI reckoned I better keep still. \\ufffdShe run on, and never\\nnoticed I had put in at all:\\n\\n\"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. \\ufffdSo there\\'s a\\nreward out for him--three hundred dollars. \\ufffdAnd there\\'s a reward out for\\nold Finn, too--two hundred dollars. \\ufffdYou see, he come to town the\\nmorning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with \\'em on the\\nferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. \\ufffdBefore night they\\nwanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. \\ufffdWell, next day they\\nfound out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn\\'t ben seen sence\\nten o\\'clock the night the murder was done. \\ufffdSo then they put it on him,\\nyou see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,\\nand went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the\\nnigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening\\nhe got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty\\nhard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. \\ufffdWell, he hain\\'t\\ncome back sence, and they ain\\'t looking for him back till this thing\\nblows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and\\nfixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he\\'d get\\nHuck\\'s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.\\n\\ufffdPeople do say he warn\\'t any too good to do it. \\ufffdOh, he\\'s sly, I reckon.\\n\\ufffdIf he don\\'t come back for a year he\\'ll be all right. \\ufffdYou can\\'t prove\\nanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and\\nhe\\'ll walk in Huck\\'s money as easy as nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I reckon so, \\'m. \\ufffdI don\\'t see nothing in the way of it. \\ufffdHas\\neverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, not everybody. \\ufffdA good many thinks he done it. \\ufffdBut they\\'ll get\\nthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.\"\\n\\n\"Why, are they after him yet?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re innocent, ain\\'t you! \\ufffdDoes three hundred dollars lay\\naround every day for people to pick up? \\ufffdSome folks think the nigger\\nain\\'t far from here. \\ufffdI\\'m one of them--but I hain\\'t talked it around. \\ufffdA\\nfew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in\\nthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to\\nthat island over yonder that they call Jackson\\'s Island. \\ufffdDon\\'t anybody\\nlive there? says I. No, nobody, says they. \\ufffdI didn\\'t say any more, but\\nI done some thinking. \\ufffdI was pretty near certain I\\'d seen smoke over\\nthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says\\nto myself, like as not that nigger\\'s hiding over there; anyway, says\\nI, it\\'s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. \\ufffdI hain\\'t seen any\\nsmoke sence, so I reckon maybe he\\'s gone, if it was him; but husband\\'s\\ngoing over to see--him and another man. \\ufffdHe was gone up the river; but he\\ngot back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.\"\\n\\nI had got so uneasy I couldn\\'t set still. \\ufffdI had to do something with my\\nhands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading\\nit. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. \\ufffdWhen the woman\\nstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious\\nand smiling a little. \\ufffdI put down the needle and thread, and let on to\\nbe interested--and I was, too--and says:\\n\\n\"Three hundred dollars is a power of money. \\ufffdI wish my mother could get\\nit. Is your husband going over there to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. \\ufffdHe went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a\\nboat and see if they could borrow another gun. \\ufffdThey\\'ll go over after\\nmidnight.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. \\ufffdAnd couldn\\'t the nigger see better, too? \\ufffdAfter midnight he\\'ll\\nlikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up\\nhis camp fire all the better for the dark, if he\\'s got one.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t think of that.\"\\n\\nThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn\\'t feel a bit\\ncomfortable. \\ufffdPretty soon she says,\\n\\n\"What did you say your name was, honey?\"\\n\\n\"M--Mary Williams.\"\\n\\nSomehow it didn\\'t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn\\'t\\nlook up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,\\nand was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. \\ufffdI wished the woman would\\nsay something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. \\ufffdBut\\nnow she says:\\n\\n\"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes\\'m, I did. \\ufffdSarah Mary Williams. \\ufffdSarah\\'s my first name. \\ufffdSome\\ncalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s the way of it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\n\\nI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. \\ufffdI\\ncouldn\\'t look up yet.\\n\\nWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor\\nthey had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\\nplace, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. \\ufffdShe was right\\nabout the rats. You\\'d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\\nevery little while. \\ufffdShe said she had to have things handy to throw at\\nthem when she was alone, or they wouldn\\'t give her no peace. \\ufffdShe showed\\nme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\\nwith it generly, but she\\'d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn\\'t\\nknow whether she could throw true now. \\ufffdBut she watched for a chance,\\nand directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\\n\"Ouch!\" it hurt her arm so. \\ufffdThen she told me to try for the next one.\\n\\ufffdI wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\\nI didn\\'t let on. \\ufffdI got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\\nnose I let drive, and if he\\'d a stayed where he was he\\'d a been a\\ntolerable sick rat. \\ufffdShe said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\\nwould hive the next one. \\ufffdShe went and got the lump of lead and fetched\\nit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\\nher with. \\ufffdI held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\\nwent on talking about her and her husband\\'s matters. \\ufffdBut she broke off\\nto say:\\n\\n\"Keep your eye on the rats. \\ufffdYou better have the lead in your lap,\\nhandy.\"\\n\\nSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\\nmy legs together on it and she went on talking. \\ufffdBut only about a\\nminute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\\nand very pleasant, and says:\\n\\n\"Come, now, what\\'s your real name?\"\\n\\n\"Wh--what, mum?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s your real name? \\ufffdIs it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?\"\\n\\nI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn\\'t know hardly what to do. \\ufffdBut\\nI says:\\n\\n\"Please to don\\'t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. \\ufffdIf I\\'m in the\\nway here, I\\'ll--\"\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t. \\ufffdSet down and stay where you are. \\ufffdI ain\\'t going to hurt\\nyou, and I ain\\'t going to tell on you, nuther. \\ufffdYou just tell me your\\nsecret, and trust me. \\ufffdI\\'ll keep it; and, what\\'s more, I\\'ll help\\nyou. So\\'ll my old man if you want him to. \\ufffdYou see, you\\'re a runaway\\n\\'prentice, that\\'s all. \\ufffdIt ain\\'t anything. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t no harm in it.\\nYou\\'ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. \\ufffdBless you,\\nchild, I wouldn\\'t tell on you. \\ufffdTell me all about it now, that\\'s a good\\nboy.\"\\n\\nSo I said it wouldn\\'t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I\\nwould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn\\'t\\ngo back on her promise. \\ufffdThen I told her my father and mother was dead,\\nand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\\nmile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn\\'t stand it\\nno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\\nchance and stole some of his daughter\\'s old clothes and cleared out, and\\nI had been three nights coming the thirty miles. \\ufffdI traveled nights,\\nand hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\\nhome lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. \\ufffdI said I believed my\\nuncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\\nout for this town of Goshen.\\n\\n\"Goshen, child? \\ufffdThis ain\\'t Goshen. \\ufffdThis is St. Petersburg. \\ufffdGoshen\\'s\\nten mile further up the river. \\ufffdWho told you this was Goshen?\"\\n\\n\"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn\\ninto the woods for my regular sleep. \\ufffdHe told me when the roads forked I\\nmust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.\"\\n\\n\"He was drunk, I reckon. \\ufffdHe told you just exactly wrong.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain\\'t no matter now. \\ufffdI got\\nto be moving along. \\ufffdI\\'ll fetch Goshen before daylight.\"\\n\\n\"Hold on a minute. \\ufffdI\\'ll put you up a snack to eat. \\ufffdYou might want it.\"\\n\\nSo she put me up a snack, and says:\\n\\n\"Say, when a cow\\'s laying down, which end of her gets up first? \\ufffdAnswer\\nup prompt now--don\\'t stop to study over it. \\ufffdWhich end gets up first?\"\\n\\n\"The hind end, mum.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, a horse?\"\\n\\n\"The for\\'rard end, mum.\"\\n\\n\"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?\"\\n\\n\"North side.\"\\n\\n\"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with\\ntheir heads pointed the same direction?\"\\n\\n\"The whole fifteen, mum.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country. \\ufffdI thought maybe you\\nwas trying to hocus me again. \\ufffdWhat\\'s your real name, now?\"\\n\\n\"George Peters, mum.\"\\n\\n\"Well, try to remember it, George. \\ufffdDon\\'t forget and tell me it\\'s\\nElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it\\'s George\\nElexander when I catch you. \\ufffdAnd don\\'t go about women in that old\\ncalico. \\ufffdYou do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.\\n\\ufffdBless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don\\'t hold the\\nthread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and\\npoke the thread at it; that\\'s the way a woman most always does, but a\\nman always does t\\'other way. \\ufffdAnd when you throw at a rat or anything,\\nhitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\\nawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\\nstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to\\nturn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out\\nto one side, like a boy. \\ufffdAnd, mind you, when a girl tries to catch\\nanything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don\\'t clap them\\ntogether, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. \\ufffdWhy, I\\nspotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived\\nthe other things just to make certain. \\ufffdNow trot along to your uncle,\\nSarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble\\nyou send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I\\'ll do what I can\\nto get you out of it. \\ufffdKeep the river road all the way, and next time\\nyou tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road\\'s a rocky one,\\nand your feet\\'ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.\"\\n\\nI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\\nand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. \\ufffdI\\njumped in, and was off in a hurry. \\ufffdI went up-stream far enough to\\nmake the head of the island, and then started across. \\ufffdI took off the\\nsun-bonnet, for I didn\\'t want no blinders on then. \\ufffdWhen I was about the\\nmiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the\\nsound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. \\ufffdWhen I struck the\\nhead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but\\nI shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started\\na good fire there on a high and dry spot.\\n\\nThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\\nbelow, as hard as I could go. \\ufffdI landed, and slopped through the timber\\nand up the ridge and into the cavern. \\ufffdThere Jim laid, sound asleep on\\nthe ground. \\ufffdI roused him out and says:\\n\\n\"Git up and hump yourself, Jim! \\ufffdThere ain\\'t a minute to lose. \\ufffdThey\\'re\\nafter us!\"\\n\\nJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he\\nworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. \\ufffdBy\\nthat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\\nready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. \\ufffdWe\\nput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn\\'t show a\\ncandle outside after that.\\n\\nI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\\nbut if there was a boat around I couldn\\'t see it, for stars and shadows\\nain\\'t good to see by. \\ufffdThen we got out the raft and slipped along down\\nin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a\\nword.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nIT must a been close on to one o\\'clock when we got below the island at\\nlast, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. \\ufffdIf a boat was to come\\nalong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\\nshore; and it was well a boat didn\\'t come, for we hadn\\'t ever thought to\\nput the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. \\ufffdWe\\nwas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. \\ufffdIt warn\\'t\\ngood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\\n\\nIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\\nbuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come. \\ufffdAnyways, they stayed\\naway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn\\'t no\\nfault of mine. \\ufffdI played it as low down on them as I could.\\n\\nWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\\nbig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\\nthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\\nhad been a cave-in in the bank there. \\ufffdA tow-head is a sandbar that has\\ncottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\\n\\nWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\\nside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\\nwarn\\'t afraid of anybody running across us. \\ufffdWe laid there all day,\\nand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\\nup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. \\ufffdI told Jim all\\nabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\\na smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn\\'t set\\ndown and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she\\'d fetch a dog. \\ufffdWell, then, I\\nsaid, why couldn\\'t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? \\ufffdJim said he\\nbet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\\nbelieved they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\\ntime, or else we wouldn\\'t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\\nbelow the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\\n\\ufffdSo I said I didn\\'t care what was the reason they didn\\'t get us as long\\nas they didn\\'t.\\n\\nWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\\ncottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\\nso Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\\nwigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\\ndry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\\nthe level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\\nreach of steamboat waves. \\ufffdRight in the middle of the wigwam we made a\\nlayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\\nto hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\\nor chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. \\ufffdWe made an extra\\nsteering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\\nor something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\\non, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\\ncoming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\\'t have\\nto light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\\na \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\\nstill a little under water; so up-bound boats didn\\'t always run the\\nchannel, but hunted easy water.\\n\\nThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\\nthat was making over four mile an hour. \\ufffdWe catched fish and talked,\\nand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. \\ufffdIt was kind of\\nsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\\nup at the stars, and we didn\\'t ever feel like talking loud, and it\\nwarn\\'t often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle. \\ufffdWe\\nhad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\\nus at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\\n\\nEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\\nnothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. \\ufffdThe\\nfifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\\nIn St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\\npeople in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\\nspread of lights at two o\\'clock that still night. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t a sound\\nthere; everybody was asleep.\\n\\nEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o\\'clock at some little\\nvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents\\' worth of meal or bacon or other\\nstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\\'t roosting\\ncomfortable, and took him along. \\ufffdPap always said, take a chicken when\\nyou get a chance, because if you don\\'t want him yourself you can easy\\nfind somebody that does, and a good deed ain\\'t ever forgot. \\ufffdI never see\\npap when he didn\\'t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\\nsay, anyway.\\n\\nMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\\nwatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\\nthat kind. \\ufffdPap always said it warn\\'t no harm to borrow things if you\\nwas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn\\'t\\nanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\\n\\ufffdJim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\\nright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\\nfrom the list and say we wouldn\\'t borrow them any more--then he reckoned\\nit wouldn\\'t be no harm to borrow the others. \\ufffdSo we talked it over all\\none night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\\nwhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\\nor what. \\ufffdBut towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\\nconcluded to drop crabapples and p\\'simmons. \\ufffdWe warn\\'t feeling just\\nright before that, but it was all comfortable now. \\ufffdI was glad the way\\nit come out, too, because crabapples ain\\'t ever good, and the p\\'simmons\\nwouldn\\'t be ripe for two or three months yet.\\n\\nWe shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\\nor didn\\'t go to bed early enough in the evening. \\ufffdTake it all round, we\\nlived pretty high.\\n\\nThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\\na power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\\nsheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\\nWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\\nand high, rocky bluffs on both sides. \\ufffdBy and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim,\\nlooky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\\n\\ufffdWe was drifting straight down for her. \\ufffdThe lightning showed her very\\ndistinct. \\ufffdShe was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\\nwater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\\nchair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\\nwhen the flashes come.\\n\\nWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\\nI felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\\nlaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. \\ufffdI\\nwanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\\nthere was there. \\ufffdSo I says:\\n\\n\"Le\\'s land on her, Jim.\"\\n\\nBut Jim was dead against it at first. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"I doan\\' want to go fool\\'n \\'long er no wrack. \\ufffdWe\\'s doin\\' blame\\' well,\\nen we better let blame\\' well alone, as de good book says. \\ufffdLike as not\\ndey\\'s a watchman on dat wrack.\"\\n\\n\"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain\\'t nothing to watch but\\nthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\\'s going to resk\\nhis life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\\nit\\'s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" \\ufffdJim\\ncouldn\\'t say nothing to that, so he didn\\'t try. \\ufffd\"And besides,\" I says,\\n\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain\\'s stateroom.\\n\\ufffdSeegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. \\ufffdSteamboat\\ncaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don\\'t\\ncare a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. \\ufffdStick a\\ncandle in your pocket; I can\\'t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\\n\\ufffdDo you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? \\ufffdNot for pie, he\\nwouldn\\'t. He\\'d call it an adventure--that\\'s what he\\'d call it; and he\\'d\\nland on that wreck if it was his last act. \\ufffdAnd wouldn\\'t he throw style\\ninto it?--wouldn\\'t he spread himself, nor nothing? \\ufffdWhy, you\\'d think it\\nwas Christopher C\\'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. \\ufffdI wish Tom Sawyer\\n_was_ here.\"\\n\\nJim he grumbled a little, but give in. \\ufffdHe said we mustn\\'t talk any more\\nthan we could help, and then talk mighty low. \\ufffdThe lightning showed us\\nthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\\nmade fast there.\\n\\nThe deck was high out here. \\ufffdWe went sneaking down the slope of it to\\nlabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\\nfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\\ndark we couldn\\'t see no sign of them. \\ufffdPretty soon we struck the forward\\nend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\\nfront of the captain\\'s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\\nthrough the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\\nseem to hear low voices in yonder!\\n\\nJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\\nalong. \\ufffdI says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\\nthen I heard a voice wail out and say:\\n\\n\"Oh, please don\\'t, boys; I swear I won\\'t ever tell!\"\\n\\nAnother voice said, pretty loud:\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lie, Jim Turner. \\ufffdYou\\'ve acted this way before. \\ufffdYou always want\\nmore\\'n your share of the truck, and you\\'ve always got it, too, because\\nyou\\'ve swore \\'t if you didn\\'t you\\'d tell. \\ufffdBut this time you\\'ve said\\nit jest one time too many. \\ufffdYou\\'re the meanest, treacherousest hound in\\nthis country.\"\\n\\nBy this time Jim was gone for the raft. \\ufffdI was just a-biling with\\ncuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn\\'t back out now,\\nand so I won\\'t either; I\\'m a-going to see what\\'s going on here. \\ufffdSo I\\ndropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\\nin the dark till there warn\\'t but one stateroom betwixt me and the\\ncross-hall of the texas. \\ufffdThen in there I see a man stretched on the\\nfloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\\nof them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\\n\\ufffdThis one kept pointing the pistol at the man\\'s head on the floor, and\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"I\\'d _like_ to! \\ufffdAnd I orter, too--a mean skunk!\"\\n\\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \"Oh, please don\\'t, Bill;\\nI hain\\'t ever goin\\' to tell.\"\\n\\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and\\nsay:\\n\\n\"\\'Deed you _ain\\'t!_ \\ufffdYou never said no truer thing \\'n that, you bet\\nyou.\" And once he said: \\ufffd\"Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn\\'t got the\\nbest of him and tied him he\\'d a killed us both. \\ufffdAnd what _for_? \\ufffdJist\\nfor noth\\'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that\\'s what for. \\ufffdBut\\nI lay you ain\\'t a-goin\\' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. \\ufffdPut\\n_up_ that pistol, Bill.\"\\n\\nBill says:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to, Jake Packard. \\ufffdI\\'m for killin\\' him--and didn\\'t he kill\\nold Hatfield jist the same way--and don\\'t he deserve it?\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t _want_ him killed, and I\\'ve got my reasons for it.\"\\n\\n\"Bless yo\\' heart for them words, Jake Packard! \\ufffdI\\'ll never forgit you\\nlong\\'s I live!\" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\\n\\nPackard didn\\'t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\\nand started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\\nto come. \\ufffdI crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\\nslanted so that I couldn\\'t make very good time; so to keep from getting\\nrun over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\\n\\ufffdThe man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my\\nstateroom, he says:\\n\\n\"Here--come in here.\"\\n\\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. \\ufffdBut before they got in I was up\\nin the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. \\ufffdThen they stood there,\\nwith their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t see\\nthem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they\\'d been having.\\n\\ufffdI was glad I didn\\'t drink whisky; but it wouldn\\'t made much difference\\nanyway, because most of the time they couldn\\'t a treed me because I\\ndidn\\'t breathe. \\ufffdI was too scared. \\ufffdAnd, besides, a body _couldn\\'t_\\nbreathe and hear such talk. \\ufffdThey talked low and earnest. \\ufffdBill wanted\\nto kill Turner. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"He\\'s said he\\'ll tell, and he will. \\ufffdIf we was to give both our shares\\nto him _now_ it wouldn\\'t make no difference after the row and the way\\nwe\\'ve served him. \\ufffdShore\\'s you\\'re born, he\\'ll turn State\\'s evidence; now\\nyou hear _me_. \\ufffdI\\'m for putting him out of his troubles.\"\\n\\n\"So\\'m I,\" says Packard, very quiet.\\n\\n\"Blame it, I\\'d sorter begun to think you wasn\\'t. \\ufffdWell, then, that\\'s all\\nright. \\ufffdLe\\'s go and do it.\"\\n\\n\"Hold on a minute; I hain\\'t had my say yit. \\ufffdYou listen to me.\\nShooting\\'s good, but there\\'s quieter ways if the thing\\'s _got_ to be\\ndone. But what I say is this: \\ufffdit ain\\'t good sense to go court\\'n around\\nafter a halter if you can git at what you\\'re up to in some way that\\'s\\njist as good and at the same time don\\'t bring you into no resks. \\ufffdAin\\'t\\nthat so?\"\\n\\n\"You bet it is. \\ufffdBut how you goin\\' to manage it this time?\"\\n\\n\"Well, my idea is this: \\ufffdwe\\'ll rustle around and gather up whatever\\npickins we\\'ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\\nthe truck. Then we\\'ll wait. \\ufffdNow I say it ain\\'t a-goin\\' to be more\\'n two\\nhours befo\\' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. \\ufffdSee?\\nHe\\'ll be drownded, and won\\'t have nobody to blame for it but his own\\nself. \\ufffdI reckon that\\'s a considerble sight better \\'n killin\\' of him.\\n\\ufffdI\\'m unfavorable to killin\\' a man as long as you can git aroun\\' it; it\\nain\\'t good sense, it ain\\'t good morals. \\ufffdAin\\'t I right?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I reck\\'n you are. \\ufffdBut s\\'pose she _don\\'t_ break up and wash off?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can\\'t we?\"\\n\\n\"All right, then; come along.\"\\n\\nSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\\nforward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\\nwhisper, \"Jim!\" and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\\nmoan, and I says:\\n\\n\"Quick, Jim, it ain\\'t no time for fooling around and moaning; there\\'s a\\ngang of murderers in yonder, and if we don\\'t hunt up their boat and set\\nher drifting down the river so these fellows can\\'t get away from the\\nwreck there\\'s one of \\'em going to be in a bad fix. \\ufffdBut if we find their\\nboat we can put _all_ of \\'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff \\'ll get \\'em.\\nQuick--hurry! \\ufffdI\\'ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\\nstart at the raft, and--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my lordy, lordy! \\ufffd_raf\\'_? \\ufffdDey ain\\' no raf\\' no mo\\'; she done broke\\nloose en gone I--en here we is!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nWELL, I catched my breath and most fainted. \\ufffdShut up on a wreck with\\nsuch a gang as that! \\ufffdBut it warn\\'t no time to be sentimentering. \\ufffdWe\\'d\\n_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. \\ufffdSo we went\\na-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\\ntoo--seemed a week before we got to the stern. \\ufffdNo sign of a boat. \\ufffdJim\\nsaid he didn\\'t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn\\'t\\nhardly any strength left, he said. \\ufffdBut I said, come on, if we get left\\non this wreck we are in a fix, sure. \\ufffdSo on we prowled again. \\ufffdWe struck\\nfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\\nforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\\nedge of the skylight was in the water. \\ufffdWhen we got pretty close to the\\ncross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! \\ufffdI could just barely\\nsee her. \\ufffdI felt ever so thankful. \\ufffdIn another second I would a been\\naboard of her, but just then the door opened. \\ufffdOne of the men stuck his\\nhead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\\nbut he jerked it in again, and says:\\n\\n\"Heave that blame lantern out o\\' sight, Bill!\"\\n\\nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\\nset down. \\ufffdIt was Packard. \\ufffdThen Bill _he_ come out and got in. \\ufffdPackard\\nsays, in a low voice:\\n\\n\"All ready--shove off!\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. \\ufffdBut Bill\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Hold on--\\'d you go through him?\"\\n\\n\"No. \\ufffdDidn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"No. \\ufffdSo he\\'s got his share o\\' the cash yet.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\"\\n\\n\"Say, won\\'t he suspicion what we\\'re up to?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe he won\\'t. \\ufffdBut we got to have it anyway. Come along.\"\\n\\nSo they got out and went in.\\n\\nThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\\nsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. \\ufffdI out with my\\nknife and cut the rope, and away we went!\\n\\nWe didn\\'t touch an oar, and we didn\\'t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even\\nbreathe. \\ufffdWe went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the\\npaddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a\\nhundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every\\nlast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\\n\\nWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\\nshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\\nby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\\nunderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\\n\\nThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. \\ufffdNow was the\\nfirst time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn\\'t\\nhad time to before. \\ufffdI begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\\nmurderers, to be in such a fix. \\ufffdI says to myself, there ain\\'t no\\ntelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would\\nI like it? \\ufffdSo says I to Jim:\\n\\n\"The first light we see we\\'ll land a hundred yards below it or above\\nit, in a place where it\\'s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and\\nthen I\\'ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for\\nthat gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when\\ntheir time comes.\"\\n\\nBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\\nand this time worse than ever. \\ufffdThe rain poured down, and never a light\\nshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon. \\ufffdWe boomed along down the river,\\nwatching for lights and watching for our raft. \\ufffdAfter a long time the\\nrain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\\nand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\\nmade for it.\\n\\nIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. \\ufffdWe\\nseen a light now away down to the right, on shore. \\ufffdSo I said I would\\ngo for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole\\nthere on the wreck. \\ufffdWe hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told\\nJim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone\\nabout two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars\\nand shoved for the light. \\ufffdAs I got down towards it three or four more\\nshowed--up on a hillside. \\ufffdIt was a village. \\ufffdI closed in above the shore\\nlight, and laid on my oars and floated. \\ufffdAs I went by I see it was a\\nlantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. \\ufffdI skimmed\\naround for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and\\nby I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between\\nhis knees. \\ufffdI gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to\\ncry.\\n\\nHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only\\nme he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\\n\\n\"Hello, what\\'s up? \\ufffdDon\\'t cry, bub. \\ufffdWhat\\'s the trouble?\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"Pap, and mam, and sis, and--\"\\n\\nThen I broke down. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Oh, dang it now, _don\\'t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,\\nand this \\'n \\'ll come out all right. \\ufffdWhat\\'s the matter with \\'em?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re--they\\'re--are you the watchman of the boat?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. \\ufffd\"I\\'m the captain\\nand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head\\ndeck-hand; and sometimes I\\'m the freight and passengers. \\ufffdI ain\\'t as\\nrich as old Jim Hornback, and I can\\'t be so blame\\' generous and good\\nto Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he\\ndoes; but I\\'ve told him a many a time \\'t I wouldn\\'t trade places with\\nhim; for, says I, a sailor\\'s life\\'s the life for me, and I\\'m derned if\\n_I\\'d_ live two mile out o\\' town, where there ain\\'t nothing ever goin\\'\\non, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. \\ufffdSays I--\"\\n\\nI broke in and says:\\n\\n\"They\\'re in an awful peck of trouble, and--\"\\n\\n\"_Who_ is?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you\\'d take your\\nferryboat and go up there--\"\\n\\n\"Up where? \\ufffdWhere are they?\"\\n\\n\"On the wreck.\"\\n\\n\"What wreck?\"\\n\\n\"Why, there ain\\'t but one.\"\\n\\n\"What, you don\\'t mean the Walter Scott?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Good land! what are they doin\\' _there_, for gracious sakes?\"\\n\\n\"Well, they didn\\'t go there a-purpose.\"\\n\\n\"I bet they didn\\'t! \\ufffdWhy, great goodness, there ain\\'t no chance for \\'em\\nif they don\\'t git off mighty quick! \\ufffdWhy, how in the nation did they\\never git into such a scrape?\"\\n\\n\"Easy enough. \\ufffdMiss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Booth\\'s Landing--go on.\"\\n\\n\"She was a-visiting there at Booth\\'s Landing, and just in the edge of\\nthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry\\nto stay all night at her friend\\'s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I\\ndisremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung\\naround and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and\\nsaddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and\\nthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard\\nthe wreck. \\ufffdWell, about an hour after dark we come along down in our\\ntrading-scow, and it was so dark we didn\\'t notice the wreck till we was\\nright on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but\\nBill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish \\'t it had\\nbeen me, I do.\"\\n\\n\"My George! \\ufffdIt\\'s the beatenest thing I ever struck. \\ufffdAnd _then_ what\\ndid you all do?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we hollered and took on, but it\\'s so wide there we couldn\\'t\\nmake nobody hear. \\ufffdSo pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help\\nsomehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,\\nand Miss Hooker she said if I didn\\'t strike help sooner, come here and\\nhunt up her uncle, and he\\'d fix the thing. \\ufffdI made the land about a mile\\nbelow, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do\\nsomething, but they said, \\'What, in such a night and such a current?\\nThere ain\\'t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.\\' \\ufffdNow if you\\'ll go\\nand--\"\\n\\n\"By Jackson, I\\'d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don\\'t know but I will; but\\nwho in the dingnation\\'s a-going\\' to _pay_ for it? \\ufffdDo you reckon your\\npap--\"\\n\\n\"Why _that\\'s_ all right. \\ufffdMiss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that\\nher uncle Hornback--\"\\n\\n\"Great guns! is _he_ her uncle? \\ufffdLooky here, you break for that light\\nover yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a\\nquarter of a mile out you\\'ll come to the tavern; tell \\'em to dart you\\nout to Jim Hornback\\'s, and he\\'ll foot the bill. \\ufffdAnd don\\'t you fool\\naround any, because he\\'ll want to know the news. \\ufffdTell him I\\'ll have\\nhis niece all safe before he can get to town. \\ufffdHump yourself, now; I\\'m\\na-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.\"\\n\\nI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back\\nand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in\\nthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among\\nsome woodboats; for I couldn\\'t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat\\nstart. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on\\naccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would\\na done it. \\ufffdI wished the widow knowed about it. \\ufffdI judged she would be\\nproud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and\\ndead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest\\nin.\\n\\nWell, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along\\ndown! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for\\nher. \\ufffdShe was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn\\'t much chance\\nfor anybody being alive in her. \\ufffdI pulled all around her and hollered\\na little, but there wasn\\'t any answer; all dead still. \\ufffdI felt a little\\nbit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they\\ncould stand it I could.\\n\\nThen here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river\\non a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach\\nI laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the\\nwreck for Miss Hooker\\'s remainders, because the captain would know her\\nuncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give\\nit up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming\\ndown the river.\\n\\nIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim\\'s light showed up; and when\\nit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. \\ufffdBy the time I\\ngot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we\\nstruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned\\nin and slept like dead people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nBY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole\\noff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all\\nsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three\\nboxes of seegars. \\ufffdWe hadn\\'t ever been this rich before in neither of\\nour lives. \\ufffdThe seegars was prime. \\ufffdWe laid off all the afternoon in the\\nwoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good\\ntime. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the\\nferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said\\nhe didn\\'t want no more adventures. \\ufffdHe said that when I went in the\\ntexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he\\nnearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could\\nbe fixed; for if he didn\\'t get saved he would get drownded; and if he\\ndid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get\\nthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. \\ufffdWell, he\\nwas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a\\nnigger.\\n\\nI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and\\nhow gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each\\nother your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, \\'stead\\nof mister; and Jim\\'s eyes bugged out, and he was interested. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"I didn\\' know dey was so many un um. \\ufffdI hain\\'t hearn \\'bout none un um,\\nskasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat\\'s in a\\npack er k\\'yards. \\ufffdHow much do a king git?\"\\n\\n\"Get?\" \\ufffdI says; \"why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want\\nit; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"_Ain\\'_ dat gay? \\ufffdEn what dey got to do, Huck?\"\\n\\n\"_They_ don\\'t do nothing! \\ufffdWhy, how you talk! They just set around.\"\\n\\n\"No; is dat so?\"\\n\\n\"Of course it is. \\ufffdThey just set around--except, maybe, when there\\'s a\\nwar; then they go to the war. \\ufffdBut other times they just lazy around; or\\ngo hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d\\' you hear a noise?\"\\n\\nWe skipped out and looked; but it warn\\'t nothing but the flutter of a\\nsteamboat\\'s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" says I, \"and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the\\nparlyment; and if everybody don\\'t go just so he whacks their heads off.\\nBut mostly they hang round the harem.\"\\n\\n\"Roun\\' de which?\"\\n\\n\"Harem.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s de harem?\"\\n\\n\"The place where he keeps his wives. \\ufffdDon\\'t you know about the harem?\\nSolomon had one; he had about a million wives.\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, dat\\'s so; I--I\\'d done forgot it. \\ufffdA harem\\'s a bo\\'d\\'n-house, I\\nreck\\'n. \\ufffdMos\\' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. \\ufffdEn I reck\\'n\\nde wives quarrels considable; en dat \\'crease de racket. \\ufffdYit dey say\\nSollermun de wises\\' man dat ever live\\'. \\ufffdI doan\\' take no stock in\\ndat.

how that snag\\'s tearing along. \\ufffdIf you think it ain\\'t dismal and\\nlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it\\nonce--you\\'ll see.\\n\\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears\\nthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn\\'t do\\nit, and directly I judged I\\'d got into a nest of towheads, for I had\\nlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow\\nchannel between, and some that I couldn\\'t see I knowed was there because\\nI\\'d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash\\nthat hung over the banks. \\ufffdWell, I warn\\'t long loosing the whoops down\\namongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,\\nanyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o\\'-lantern. \\ufffdYou never\\nknowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\\n\\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to\\nkeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the\\nraft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would\\nget further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little\\nfaster than what I was.\\n\\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn\\'t\\nhear no sign of a whoop nowheres. \\ufffdI reckoned Jim had fetched up on a\\nsnag, maybe, and it was all up with him. \\ufffdI was good and tired, so I\\nlaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn\\'t bother no more. \\ufffdI didn\\'t\\nwant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn\\'t help it;\\nso I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.\\n\\nBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars\\nwas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a\\nbig bend stern first. \\ufffdFirst I didn\\'t know where I was; I thought I was\\ndreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come\\nup dim out of last week.\\n\\nIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest\\nkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see\\nby the stars. \\ufffdI looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the\\nwater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn\\'t nothing but a\\ncouple of sawlogs made fast together. \\ufffdThen I see another speck, and\\nchased that; then another, and this time I was right. \\ufffdIt was the raft.\\n\\nWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his\\nknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. \\ufffdThe\\nother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and\\nbranches and dirt. \\ufffdSo she\\'d had a rough time.\\n\\nI made fast and laid down under Jim\\'s nose on the raft, and began to\\ngap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:\\n\\n\"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? \\ufffdWhy didn\\'t you stir me up?\"\\n\\n\"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? \\ufffdEn you ain\\' dead--you ain\\'\\ndrownded--you\\'s back agin? \\ufffdIt\\'s too good for true, honey, it\\'s too good\\nfor true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o\\' you. \\ufffdNo, you ain\\'\\ndead! you\\'s back agin, \\'live en soun\\', jis de same ole Huck--de same ole\\nHuck, thanks to goodness!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, Jim? \\ufffdYou been a-drinking?\"\\n\\n\"Drinkin\\'? \\ufffdHas I ben a-drinkin\\'? \\ufffdHas I had a chance to be a-drinkin\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?\"\\n\\n\"How does I talk wild?\"\\n\\n\"_How_? \\ufffdWhy, hain\\'t you been talking about my coming back, and all that\\nstuff, as if I\\'d been gone away?\"\\n\\n\"Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. \\ufffd_Hain\\'t_ you\\nben gone away?\"\\n\\n\"Gone away? \\ufffdWhy, what in the nation do you mean? \\ufffdI hain\\'t been gone\\nanywheres. \\ufffdWhere would I go to?\"\\n\\n\"Well, looky here, boss, dey\\'s sumf\\'n wrong, dey is. \\ufffdIs I _me_, or who\\n_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I? \\ufffdNow dat\\'s what I wants to know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I think you\\'re here, plain enough, but I think you\\'re a\\ntangle-headed old fool, Jim.\"\\n\\n\"I is, is I? \\ufffdWell, you answer me dis: \\ufffdDidn\\'t you tote out de line in\\nde canoe fer to make fas\\' to de tow-head?\"\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t. \\ufffdWhat tow-head? \\ufffdI hain\\'t see no tow-head.\"\\n\\n\"You hain\\'t seen no towhead? \\ufffdLooky here, didn\\'t de line pull loose en\\nde raf\\' go a-hummin\\' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in\\nde fog?\"\\n\\n\"What fog?\"\\n\\n\"Why, de fog!--de fog dat\\'s been aroun\\' all night. \\ufffdEn didn\\'t you whoop,\\nen didn\\'t I whoop, tell we got mix\\' up in de islands en one un us got\\nlos\\' en t\\'other one was jis\\' as good as los\\', \\'kase he didn\\' know whah\\nhe wuz? En didn\\'t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible\\ntime en mos\\' git drownded? \\ufffdNow ain\\' dat so, boss--ain\\'t it so? \\ufffdYou\\nanswer me dat.\"\\n\\n\"Well, this is too many for me, Jim. \\ufffdI hain\\'t seen no fog, nor no\\nislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. \\ufffdI been setting here talking with\\nyou all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon\\nI done the same. \\ufffdYou couldn\\'t a got drunk in that time, so of course\\nyou\\'ve been dreaming.\"\\n\\n\"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\"\\n\\n\"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn\\'t any of it\\nhappen.\"\\n\\n\"But, Huck, it\\'s all jis\\' as plain to me as--\"\\n\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference how plain it is; there ain\\'t nothing in it.\\nI know, because I\\'ve been here all the time.\"\\n\\nJim didn\\'t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying\\nover it. \\ufffdThen he says:\\n\\n\"Well, den, I reck\\'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain\\'t\\nde powerfullest dream I ever see. \\ufffdEn I hain\\'t ever had no dream b\\'fo\\'\\ndat\\'s tired me like dis one.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, that\\'s all right, because a dream does tire a body like\\neverything sometimes. \\ufffdBut this one was a staving dream; tell me all\\nabout it, Jim.\"\\n\\nSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as\\nit happened, only he painted it up considerable. \\ufffdThen he said he must\\nstart in and \"\\'terpret\" it, because it was sent for a warning. \\ufffdHe said\\nthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but\\nthe current was another man that would get us away from him. \\ufffdThe whoops\\nwas warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn\\'t\\ntry hard to make out to understand them they\\'d just take us into bad\\nluck, \\'stead of keeping us out of it. \\ufffdThe lot of towheads was troubles\\nwe was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean\\nfolks, but if we minded our business and didn\\'t talk back and aggravate\\nthem, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big\\nclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn\\'t have no more\\ntrouble.\\n\\nIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it\\nwas clearing up again now.\\n\\n\"Oh, well, that\\'s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,\" I\\nsays; \"but what does _these_ things stand for?\"\\n\\nIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. \\ufffdYou\\ncould see them first-rate now.\\n\\nJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash\\nagain. \\ufffdHe had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he\\ncouldn\\'t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place\\nagain right away. \\ufffdBut when he did get the thing straightened around he\\nlooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:\\n\\n\"What do dey stan\\' for? \\ufffdI\\'se gwyne to tell you. \\ufffdWhen I got all wore\\nout wid work, en wid de callin\\' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz\\nmos\\' broke bekase you wuz los\\', en I didn\\' k\\'yer no\\' mo\\' what become\\ner me en de raf\\'. \\ufffdEn when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe\\nen soun\\', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo\\'\\nfoot, I\\'s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin\\' \\'bout wuz how you could\\nmake a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. \\ufffdDat truck dah is _trash_; en trash\\nis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren\\'s en makes \\'em\\nashamed.\"\\n\\nThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without\\nsaying anything but that. \\ufffdBut that was enough. \\ufffdIt made me feel so mean\\nI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.\\n\\nIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble\\nmyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn\\'t ever sorry for it\\nafterwards, neither. \\ufffdI didn\\'t do him no more mean tricks, and I\\nwouldn\\'t done that one if I\\'d a knowed it would make him feel that way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nWE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\\nmonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. \\ufffdShe had\\nfour long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\\nmen, likely. \\ufffdShe had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\\ncamp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. \\ufffdThere was a\\npower of style about her. \\ufffdIt _amounted_ to something being a raftsman\\non such a craft as that.\\n\\nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\\nhot. \\ufffdThe river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\\nboth sides; you couldn\\'t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. \\ufffdWe\\ntalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\\nit. \\ufffdI said likely we wouldn\\'t, because I had heard say there warn\\'t but\\nabout a dozen houses there, and if they didn\\'t happen to have them lit\\nup, how was we going to know we was passing a town? \\ufffdJim said if the two\\nbig rivers joined together there, that would show. \\ufffdBut I said maybe\\nwe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the\\nsame old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. \\ufffdSo the question\\nwas, what to do? \\ufffdI said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,\\nand tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and\\nwas a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to\\nCairo. \\ufffdJim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and\\nwaited.\\n\\nThere warn\\'t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\\nnot pass it without seeing it. \\ufffdHe said he\\'d be mighty sure to see it,\\nbecause he\\'d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\\nhe\\'d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. \\ufffdEvery\\nlittle while he jumps up and says:\\n\\n\"Dah she is?\"\\n\\nBut it warn\\'t. \\ufffdIt was Jack-o\\'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set\\ndown again, and went to watching, same as before. \\ufffdJim said it made him\\nall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. \\ufffdWell, I can\\ntell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\\nbecause I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and\\nwho was to blame for it? \\ufffdWhy, _me_. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t get that out of my\\nconscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn\\'t\\nrest; I couldn\\'t stay still in one place. \\ufffdIt hadn\\'t ever come home to\\nme before, what this thing was that I was doing. \\ufffdBut now it did; and it\\nstayed with me, and scorched me more and more. \\ufffdI tried to make out to\\nmyself that I warn\\'t to blame, because I didn\\'t run Jim off from his\\nrightful owner; but it warn\\'t no use, conscience up and says, every\\ntime, \"But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a\\npaddled ashore and told somebody.\" \\ufffdThat was so--I couldn\\'t get around\\nthat noway. \\ufffdThat was where it pinched. \\ufffdConscience says to me, \"What\\nhad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off\\nright under your eyes and never say one single word? \\ufffdWhat did that poor\\nold woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? \\ufffdWhy, she tried to\\nlearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to\\nbe good to you every way she knowed how. \\ufffd_That\\'s_ what she done.\"\\n\\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. \\ufffdI\\nfidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was\\nfidgeting up and down past me. \\ufffdWe neither of us could keep still.\\n\\ufffdEvery time he danced around and says, \"Dah\\'s Cairo!\" it went through me\\nlike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of\\nmiserableness.\\n\\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. \\ufffdHe was\\nsaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he\\nwould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he\\ngot enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to\\nwhere Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the\\ntwo children, and if their master wouldn\\'t sell them, they\\'d get an\\nAb\\'litionist to go and steal them.\\n\\nIt most froze me to hear such talk. \\ufffdHe wouldn\\'t ever dared to talk such\\ntalk in his life before. \\ufffdJust see what a difference it made in him the\\nminute he judged he was about free. \\ufffdIt was according to the old saying,\\n\"Give a nigger an inch and he\\'ll take an ell.\" \\ufffdThinks I, this is what\\ncomes of my not thinking. \\ufffdHere was this nigger, which I had as good\\nas helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would\\nsteal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn\\'t even know; a\\nman that hadn\\'t ever done me no harm.\\n\\nI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. \\ufffdMy\\nconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says\\nto it, \"Let up on me--it ain\\'t too late yet--I\\'ll paddle ashore at the\\nfirst light and tell.\" \\ufffdI felt easy and happy and light as a feather\\nright off. \\ufffdAll my troubles was gone. \\ufffdI went to looking out sharp for a\\nlight, and sort of singing to myself. \\ufffdBy and by one showed. \\ufffdJim sings\\nout:\\n\\n\"We\\'s safe, Huck, we\\'s safe! \\ufffdJump up and crack yo\\' heels! \\ufffdDat\\'s de\\ngood ole Cairo at las\\', I jis knows it!\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. \\ufffdIt mightn\\'t be, you know.\"\\n\\nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom\\nfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\\n\\n\"Pooty soon I\\'ll be a-shout\\'n\\' for joy, en I\\'ll say, it\\'s all on\\naccounts o\\' Huck; I\\'s a free man, en I couldn\\'t ever ben free ef it\\nhadn\\' ben for Huck; Huck done it. \\ufffdJim won\\'t ever forgit you, Huck;\\nyou\\'s de bes\\' fren\\' Jim\\'s ever had; en you\\'s de _only_ fren\\' ole Jim\\'s\\ngot now.\"\\n\\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says\\nthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. \\ufffdI went along\\nslow then, and I warn\\'t right down certain whether I was glad I started\\nor whether I warn\\'t. \\ufffdWhen I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\\n\\n\"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on\\'y white genlman dat ever kep\\' his\\npromise to ole Jim.\"\\n\\nWell, I just felt sick. \\ufffdBut I says, I _got_ to do it--I can\\'t get _out_\\nof it. \\ufffdRight then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and\\nthey stopped and I stopped. \\ufffdOne of them says:\\n\\n\"What\\'s that yonder?\"\\n\\n\"A piece of a raft,\" I says.\\n\\n\"Do you belong on it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Any men on it?\"\\n\\n\"Only one, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head\\nof the bend. \\ufffdIs your man white or black?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t answer up prompt. \\ufffdI tried to, but the words wouldn\\'t come. I\\ntried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn\\'t man\\nenough--hadn\\'t the spunk of a rabbit. \\ufffdI see I was weakening; so I just\\ngive up trying, and up and says:\\n\\n\"He\\'s white.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon we\\'ll go and see for ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would,\" says I, \"because it\\'s pap that\\'s there, and maybe\\nyou\\'d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. \\ufffdHe\\'s sick--and so\\nis mam and Mary Ann.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the devil! we\\'re in a hurry, boy. \\ufffdBut I s\\'pose we\\'ve got to.\\n\\ufffdCome, buckle to your paddle, and let\\'s get along.\"\\n\\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. \\ufffdWhen we had made a\\nstroke or two, I says:\\n\\n\"Pap\\'ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. \\ufffdEverybody goes\\naway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can\\'t do it\\nby myself.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s infernal mean. \\ufffdOdd, too. \\ufffdSay, boy, what\\'s the matter\\nwith your father?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the--a--the--well, it ain\\'t anything much.\"\\n\\nThey stopped pulling. \\ufffdIt warn\\'t but a mighty little ways to the raft\\nnow. One says:\\n\\n\"Boy, that\\'s a lie. \\ufffdWhat _is_ the matter with your pap? \\ufffdAnswer up\\nsquare now, and it\\'ll be the better for you.\"\\n\\n\"I will, sir, I will, honest--but don\\'t leave us, please. \\ufffdIt\\'s\\nthe--the--Gentlemen, if you\\'ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the\\nheadline, you won\\'t have to come a-near the raft--please do.\"\\n\\n\"Set her back, John, set her back!\" says one. \\ufffdThey backed water. \\ufffd\"Keep\\naway, boy--keep to looard. \\ufffdConfound it, I just expect the wind has\\nblowed it to us. \\ufffdYour pap\\'s got the small-pox, and you know it precious\\nwell. \\ufffdWhy didn\\'t you come out and say so? \\ufffdDo you want to spread it all\\nover?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says I, a-blubbering, \"I\\'ve told everybody before, and they just\\nwent away and left us.\"\\n\\n\"Poor devil, there\\'s something in that. \\ufffdWe are right down sorry for\\nyou, but we--well, hang it, we don\\'t want the small-pox, you see. \\ufffdLook\\nhere, I\\'ll tell you what to do. \\ufffdDon\\'t you try to land by yourself, or\\nyou\\'ll smash everything to pieces. \\ufffdYou float along down about twenty\\nmiles, and you\\'ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. \\ufffdIt\\nwill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them\\nyour folks are all down with chills and fever. \\ufffdDon\\'t be a fool again,\\nand let people guess what is the matter. \\ufffdNow we\\'re trying to do you a\\nkindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that\\'s a good boy.\\n\\ufffdIt wouldn\\'t do any good to land yonder where the light is--it\\'s only a\\nwood-yard. Say, I reckon your father\\'s poor, and I\\'m bound to say he\\'s\\nin pretty hard luck. \\ufffdHere, I\\'ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this\\nboard, and you get it when it floats by. \\ufffdI feel mighty mean to leave\\nyou; but my kingdom! it won\\'t do to fool with small-pox, don\\'t you see?\"\\n\\n\"Hold on, Parker,\" says the other man, \"here\\'s a twenty to put on the\\nboard for me. \\ufffdGood-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you\\'ll\\nbe all right.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye. \\ufffdIf you see any runaway niggers\\nyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir,\" says I; \"I won\\'t let no runaway niggers get by me if I\\ncan help it.\"\\n\\nThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I\\nknowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn\\'t no use for me\\nto try to learn to do right; a body that don\\'t get _started_ right when\\nhe\\'s little ain\\'t got no show--when the pinch comes there ain\\'t nothing\\nto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. \\ufffdThen I\\nthought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s\\'pose you\\'d a done right\\nand give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? \\ufffdNo, says\\nI, I\\'d feel bad--I\\'d feel just the same way I do now. \\ufffdWell, then, says\\nI, what\\'s the use you learning to do right when it\\'s troublesome to do\\nright and ain\\'t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?\\n\\ufffdI was stuck. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t answer that. \\ufffdSo I reckoned I wouldn\\'t bother\\nno more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at\\nthe time.\\n\\nI went into the wigwam; Jim warn\\'t there. \\ufffdI looked all around; he\\nwarn\\'t anywhere. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Jim!\"\\n\\n\"Here I is, Huck. \\ufffdIs dey out o\\' sight yit? \\ufffdDon\\'t talk loud.\"\\n\\nHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. \\ufffdI told\\nhim they were out of sight, so he come aboard. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"I was a-listenin\\' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne\\nto shove for sho\\' if dey come aboard. \\ufffdDen I was gwyne to swim to de\\nraf\\' agin when dey was gone. \\ufffdBut lawsy, how you did fool \\'em, Huck!\\n\\ufffdDat _wuz_ de smartes\\' dodge! \\ufffdI tell you, chile, I\\'spec it save\\' ole\\nJim--ole Jim ain\\'t going to forgit you for dat, honey.\"\\n\\nThen we talked about the money. \\ufffdIt was a pretty good raise--twenty\\ndollars apiece. \\ufffdJim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat\\nnow, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free\\nStates. He said twenty mile more warn\\'t far for the raft to go, but he\\nwished we was already there.\\n\\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding\\nthe raft good. \\ufffdThen he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and\\ngetting all ready to quit rafting.\\n\\nThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down\\nin a left-hand bend.\\n\\nI went off in the canoe to ask about it. \\ufffdPretty soon I found a man out\\nin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. \\ufffdI ranged up and says:\\n\\n\"Mister, is that town Cairo?\"\\n\\n\"Cairo? no. \\ufffdYou must be a blame\\' fool.\"\\n\\n\"What town is it, mister?\"\\n\\n\"If you want to know, go and find out. \\ufffdIf you stay here botherin\\'\\naround me for about a half a minute longer you\\'ll get something you\\nwon\\'t want.\"\\n\\nI paddled to the raft. \\ufffdJim was awful disappointed, but I said never\\nmind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\\n\\nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but\\nit was high ground, so I didn\\'t go. \\ufffdNo high ground about Cairo, Jim\\nsaid. I had forgot it. \\ufffdWe laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable\\nclose to the left-hand bank. \\ufffdI begun to suspicion something. \\ufffdSo did\\nJim. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.\"\\n\\nHe says:\\n\\n\"Doan\\' le\\'s talk about it, Huck. \\ufffdPo\\' niggers can\\'t have no luck. \\ufffdI\\nawluz \\'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn\\'t done wid its work.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I\\'d never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I\\'d never laid\\neyes on it.\"\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t yo\\' fault, Huck; you didn\\' know. \\ufffdDon\\'t you blame yo\\'self\\n\\'bout it.\"\\n\\nWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure\\nenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! \\ufffdSo it was all up with\\nCairo.\\n\\nWe talked it all over. \\ufffdIt wouldn\\'t do to take to the shore; we couldn\\'t\\ntake the raft up the stream, of course. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t no way but to wait\\nfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. \\ufffdSo we slept\\nall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,\\nand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!\\n\\nWe didn\\'t say a word for a good while. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t anything to\\nsay. \\ufffdWe both knowed well enough it was some more work of the\\nrattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? \\ufffdIt would only\\nlook like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more\\nbad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep\\nstill.\\n\\nBy and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn\\'t no\\nway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy\\na canoe to go back in. \\ufffdWe warn\\'t going to borrow it when there warn\\'t\\nanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\\nus.\\n\\nSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.\\n\\nAnybody that don\\'t believe yet that it\\'s foolishness to handle a\\nsnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it\\nnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.\\n\\nThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. \\ufffdBut we\\ndidn\\'t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and\\nmore. \\ufffdWell, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\\nmeanest thing to fog. \\ufffdYou can\\'t tell the shape of the river, and you\\ncan\\'t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\\ncomes a steamboat up the river. \\ufffdWe lit the lantern, and judged she\\nwould see it. \\ufffdUp-stream boats didn\\'t generly come close to us; they\\ngo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but\\nnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\\n\\nWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn\\'t see her good till she\\nwas close. \\ufffdShe aimed right for us. \\ufffdOften they do that and try to see\\nhow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\\na sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\\nhe\\'s mighty smart. \\ufffdWell, here she comes, and we said she was going to\\ntry and shave us; but she didn\\'t seem to be sheering off a bit. \\ufffdShe\\nwas a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\\ncloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\\nout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\\nlike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\\nover us. \\ufffdThere was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\\nengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\\noverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\\nthrough the raft.\\n\\nI dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\\nhad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. \\ufffdI could\\nalways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\\nminute and a half. \\ufffdThen I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\\nnearly busting. \\ufffdI popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\\nmy nose, and puffed a bit. \\ufffdOf course there was a booming current; and\\nof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\\nstopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\\nchurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\\ncould hear her.\\n\\nI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn\\'t get any answer;\\nso I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \"treading water,\" and\\nstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. \\ufffdBut I made out to see\\nthat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\\nmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\\n\\nIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\\nlong time in getting over. \\ufffdI made a safe landing, and clumb up the\\nbank. I couldn\\'t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\\nrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\\nbig old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. \\ufffdI was going to\\nrush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\\nand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nIN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his\\nhead out, and says:\\n\\n\"Be done, boys! \\ufffdWho\\'s there?\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s me.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s me?\"\\n\\n\"George Jackson, sir.\"\\n\\n\"What do you want?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want nothing, sir. \\ufffdI only want to go along by, but the dogs\\nwon\\'t let me.\"\\n\\n\"What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?\"\\n\\n\"I warn\\'t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you did, did you? \\ufffdStrike a light there, somebody. \\ufffdWhat did you\\nsay your name was?\"\\n\\n\"George Jackson, sir. \\ufffdI\\'m only a boy.\"\\n\\n\"Look here, if you\\'re telling the truth you needn\\'t be afraid--nobody\\'ll\\nhurt you. \\ufffdBut don\\'t try to budge; stand right where you are. \\ufffdRouse out\\nBob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. \\ufffdGeorge Jackson, is there\\nanybody with you?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, nobody.\"\\n\\nI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.\\nThe man sung out:\\n\\n\"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain\\'t you got any sense?\\nPut it on the floor behind the front door. \\ufffdBob, if you and Tom are\\nready, take your places.\"\\n\\n\"All ready.\"\\n\\n\"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; I never heard of them.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that may be so, and it mayn\\'t. \\ufffdNow, all ready. \\ufffdStep forward,\\nGeorge Jackson. \\ufffdAnd mind, don\\'t you hurry--come mighty slow. \\ufffdIf there\\'s\\nanybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he\\'ll be shot.\\nCome along now. \\ufffdCome slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to\\nsqueeze in, d\\' you hear?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t hurry; I couldn\\'t if I\\'d a wanted to. \\ufffdI took one slow step at\\na time and there warn\\'t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.\\n\\ufffdThe dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind\\nme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and\\nunbarring and unbolting. \\ufffdI put my hand on the door and pushed it a\\nlittle and a little more till somebody said, \"There, that\\'s enough--put\\nyour head in.\" I done it, but I judged they would take it off.\\n\\nThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and\\nme at them, for about a quarter of a minute: \\ufffdThree big men with guns\\npointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray\\nand about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and\\nhandsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two\\nyoung women which I couldn\\'t see right well. \\ufffdThe old gentleman says:\\n\\n\"There; I reckon it\\'s all right. \\ufffdCome in.\"\\n\\nAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it\\nand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and\\nthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,\\nand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front\\nwindows--there warn\\'t none on the side. \\ufffdThey held the candle, and took a\\ngood look at me, and all said, \"Why, _he_ ain\\'t a Shepherdson--no, there\\nain\\'t any Shepherdson about him.\" \\ufffdThen the old man said he hoped I\\nwouldn\\'t mind being searched for arms, because he didn\\'t mean no harm by\\nit--it was only to make sure. \\ufffdSo he didn\\'t pry into my pockets, but only\\nfelt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. \\ufffdHe told me to\\nmake myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old\\nlady says:\\n\\n\"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing\\'s as wet as he can be; and don\\'t\\nyou reckon it may be he\\'s hungry?\"\\n\\n\"True for you, Rachel--I forgot.\"\\n\\nSo the old lady says:\\n\\n\"Betsy\" (this was a nigger woman), \"you fly around and get him something\\nto eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake\\nup Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself. \\ufffdBuck, take this little\\nstranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some\\nof yours that\\'s dry.\"\\n\\nBuck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,\\nthough he was a little bigger than me. \\ufffdHe hadn\\'t on anything but a\\nshirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. \\ufffdHe came in gaping and digging one\\nfist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.\\nHe says:\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t they no Shepherdsons around?\"\\n\\nThey said, no, \\'twas a false alarm.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he says, \"if they\\'d a ben some, I reckon I\\'d a got one.\"\\n\\nThey all laughed, and Bob says:\\n\\n\"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you\\'ve been so slow in\\ncoming.\"\\n\\n\"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain\\'t right I\\'m always kept down; I\\ndon\\'t get no show.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Buck, my boy,\" says the old man, \"you\\'ll have show enough,\\nall in good time, don\\'t you fret about that. \\ufffdGo \\'long with you now, and\\ndo as your mother told you.\"\\n\\nWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a\\nroundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. \\ufffdWhile I was at it he\\nasked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to\\ntell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods\\nday before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle\\nwent out. \\ufffdI said I didn\\'t know; I hadn\\'t heard about it before, no way.\\n\\n\"Well, guess,\" he says.\\n\\n\"How\\'m I going to guess,\" says I, \"when I never heard tell of it\\nbefore?\"\\n\\n\"But you can guess, can\\'t you? \\ufffdIt\\'s just as easy.\"\\n\\n\"_Which_ candle?\" \\ufffdI says.\\n\\n\"Why, any candle,\" he says.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know where he was,\" says I; \"where was he?\"\\n\\n\"Why, he was in the _dark_! \\ufffdThat\\'s where he was!\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?\"\\n\\n\"Why, blame it, it\\'s a riddle, don\\'t you see? \\ufffdSay, how long are you\\ngoing to stay here? \\ufffdYou got to stay always. \\ufffdWe can just have booming\\ntimes--they don\\'t have no school now. \\ufffdDo you own a dog? \\ufffdI\\'ve got a\\ndog--and he\\'ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. \\ufffdDo\\nyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? \\ufffdYou bet\\nI don\\'t, but ma she makes me. \\ufffdConfound these ole britches! \\ufffdI reckon\\nI\\'d better put \\'em on, but I\\'d ruther not, it\\'s so warm. \\ufffdAre you all\\nready? All right. \\ufffdCome along, old hoss.\"\\n\\nCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they\\nhad for me down there, and there ain\\'t nothing better that ever I\\'ve\\ncome across yet. \\ufffdBuck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,\\nexcept the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. \\ufffdThey\\nall smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. \\ufffdThe young women had\\nquilts around them, and their hair down their backs. \\ufffdThey all asked me\\nquestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living\\non a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\\nrun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\\nto hunt them and he warn\\'t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,\\nand then there warn\\'t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just\\ntrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died\\nI took what there was left, because the farm didn\\'t belong to us, and\\nstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how\\nI come to be here. \\ufffdSo they said I could have a home there as long as I\\nwanted it. \\ufffdThen it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I\\nwent to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,\\nI had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to\\nthink, and when Buck waked up I says:\\n\\n\"Can you spell, Buck?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he says.\\n\\n\"I bet you can\\'t spell my name,\" says I.\\n\\n\"I bet you what you dare I can,\" says he.\\n\\n\"All right,\" says I, \"go ahead.\"\\n\\n\"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,\" he says.\\n\\n\"Well,\" says I, \"you done it, but I didn\\'t think you could. \\ufffdIt ain\\'t no\\nslouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.\"\\n\\nI set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\\nnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was\\nused to it.\\n\\nIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. \\ufffdI hadn\\'t\\nseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much\\nstyle. \\ufffdIt didn\\'t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one\\nwith a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\\ntown. There warn\\'t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\\nof parlors in towns has beds in them. \\ufffdThere was a big fireplace that\\nwas bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\\npouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\\nthey wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\\nsame as they do in town. \\ufffdThey had big brass dog-irons that could hold\\nup a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\\na picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\\na round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\\npendulum swinging behind it. \\ufffdIt was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\\nand sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\\nup and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\\nand fifty before she got tuckered out. \\ufffdThey wouldn\\'t took any money for\\nher.\\n\\nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\\nmade out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. \\ufffdBy one of the\\nparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\\nand when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn\\'t open\\ntheir mouths nor look different nor interested. \\ufffdThey squeaked through\\nunderneath. \\ufffdThere was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\\nbehind those things. \\ufffdOn the table in the middle of the room was a kind\\nof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\\ngrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\\nthan real ones is, but they warn\\'t real because you could see where\\npieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\\nwas, underneath.\\n\\nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\\nblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. \\ufffdIt\\ncome all the way from Philadelphia, they said. \\ufffdThere was some books,\\ntoo, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. \\ufffdOne was a\\nbig family Bible full of pictures. \\ufffdOne was Pilgrim\\'s Progress, about a\\nman that left his family, it didn\\'t say why. \\ufffdI read considerable in it\\nnow and then. \\ufffdThe statements was interesting, but tough. \\ufffdAnother was\\nFriendship\\'s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn\\'t\\nread the poetry. \\ufffdAnother was Henry Clay\\'s Speeches, and another was Dr.\\nGunn\\'s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\\nwas sick or dead. \\ufffdThere was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. \\ufffdAnd\\nthere was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\\ndown in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\\n\\nThey had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\\nand battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \"Signing the\\nDeclaration.\" There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\\ndaughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\\nfifteen years old. \\ufffdThey was different from any pictures I ever see\\nbefore--blacker, mostly, than is common. \\ufffdOne was a woman in a slim black\\ndress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\\nthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\\na black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\\nvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\\ntombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\\nhanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\\nand underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\"\\n\\ufffdAnother one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\\nto the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\\nchair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\\nlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\\nthe picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"\\n\\ufffdThere was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\\nmoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\\none hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\\nmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\\nthe picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\" \\ufffdThese\\nwas all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn\\'t somehow seem to take\\nto them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\\nfan-tods. \\ufffdEverybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\\nmore of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\\nwhat they had lost. \\ufffdBut I reckoned that with her disposition she was\\nhaving a better time in the graveyard. \\ufffdShe was at work on what they\\nsaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\\nevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\\ndone, but she never got the chance. \\ufffdIt was a picture of a young woman\\nin a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\\noff, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\\nthe tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\\nbreast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\\ntowards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\\nand then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\\nbefore she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\\nhead of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\\nflowers on it. \\ufffdOther times it was hid with a little curtain. \\ufffdThe young\\nwoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\\nmany arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\\n\\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\\nobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\\nPresbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\\nIt was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name\\nof Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\\n\\nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC\\'D\\n\\nAnd did young Stephen sicken, \\ufffd \\ufffdAnd did young Stephen die? And did the\\nsad hearts thicken, \\ufffd \\ufffdAnd did the mourners cry?\\n\\nNo; such was not the fate of \\ufffd \\ufffdYoung Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad\\nhearts round him thickened, \\ufffd \\ufffd\\'Twas not from sickness\\' shots.\\n\\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame, \\ufffd \\ufffdNor measles drear with spots;\\nNot these impaired the sacred name \\ufffd \\ufffdOf Stephen Dowling Bots.\\n\\nDespised love struck not with woe \\ufffd \\ufffdThat head of curly knots, Nor\\nstomach troubles laid him low, \\ufffd \\ufffdYoung Stephen Dowling Bots.\\n\\nO no. Then list with tearful eye, \\ufffd \\ufffdWhilst I his fate do tell. His soul\\ndid from this cold world fly \\ufffd \\ufffdBy falling down a well.\\n\\nThey got him out and emptied him; \\ufffd \\ufffdAlas it was too late; His spirit\\nwas gone for to sport aloft \\ufffd \\ufffdIn the realms of the good and great.\\n\\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was\\nfourteen, there ain\\'t no telling what she could a done by and by. \\ufffdBuck\\nsaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing. \\ufffdShe didn\\'t ever have to\\nstop to think. \\ufffdHe said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn\\'t\\nfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down\\nanother one, and go ahead. She warn\\'t particular; she could write about\\nanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.\\nEvery time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on\\nhand with her \"tribute\" before he was cold. \\ufffdShe called them tributes.\\nThe neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the\\nundertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and\\nthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person\\'s name, which was\\nWhistler. \\ufffdShe warn\\'t ever the same after that; she never complained,\\nbut she kinder pined away and did not live long. \\ufffdPoor thing, many\\'s the\\ntime I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get\\nout her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been\\naggravating me and I had soured on her a little. \\ufffdI liked all that\\nfamily, dead ones and all, and warn\\'t going to let anything come between\\nus. \\ufffdPoor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was\\nalive, and it didn\\'t seem right that there warn\\'t nobody to make some\\nabout her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\\nmyself, but I couldn\\'t seem to make it go somehow. \\ufffdThey kept Emmeline\\'s\\nroom trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she\\nliked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.\\n\\ufffdThe old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty\\nof niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there\\nmostly.\\n\\nWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on\\nthe windows: \\ufffdwhite, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines\\nall down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. \\ufffdThere was a little\\nold piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever\\nso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing \"The Last Link is Broken\"\\nand play \"The Battle of Prague\" on it. \\ufffdThe walls of all the rooms was\\nplastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was\\nwhitewashed on the outside.\\n\\nIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed\\nand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the\\nday, and it was a cool, comfortable place. \\ufffdNothing couldn\\'t be better.\\n\\ufffdAnd warn\\'t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nCOL. \\ufffdGrangerford was a gentleman, you see. \\ufffdHe was a gentleman all\\nover; and so was his family. \\ufffdHe was well born, as the saying is, and\\nthat\\'s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\\nsaid, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\\nin our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn\\'t no more\\nquality than a mudcat himself. \\ufffdCol. \\ufffdGrangerford was very tall and\\nvery slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\\nanywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\\nhe had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\\na high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\\ndeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\\nyou, as you may say. \\ufffdHis forehead was high, and his hair was black and\\nstraight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\\nevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\\nto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\\nand on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. \\ufffdHe\\ncarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t no\\nfrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\\'t ever loud. \\ufffdHe was\\nas kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\\nconfidence. \\ufffdSometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\\nstraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\\nflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\\nand find out what the matter was afterwards. \\ufffdHe didn\\'t ever have to\\ntell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\\nwhere he was. \\ufffdEverybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\\nmost always--I mean he made it seem like good weather. \\ufffdWhen he turned\\ninto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\\nenough; there wouldn\\'t nothing go wrong again for a week.\\n\\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\\nup out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn\\'t set down again\\ntill they had set down. \\ufffdThen Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\\nthe decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\\nhe held it in his hand and waited till Tom\\'s and Bob\\'s was mixed, and\\nthen they bowed and said, \"Our duty to you, sir, and madam;\" and _they_\\nbowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\\nall three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\\nthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\\ngive it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\\n\\nBob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad\\nshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. \\ufffdThey\\ndressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\\nwore broad Panama hats.\\n\\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\\nand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn\\'t stirred up; but\\nwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\\nlike her father. \\ufffdShe was beautiful.\\n\\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. \\ufffdShe was\\ngentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\\n\\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too. \\ufffdMy nigger\\nhad a monstrous easy time, because I warn\\'t used to having anybody do\\nanything for me, but Buck\\'s was on the jump most of the time.\\n\\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be\\nmore--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\\n\\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\\nSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\\nfifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings\\nround about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\\ndaytimes, and balls at the house nights. \\ufffdThese people was mostly\\nkinfolks of the family. \\ufffdThe men brought their guns with them. \\ufffdIt was a\\nhandsome lot of quality, I tell you.\\n\\nThere was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\\nfamilies--mostly of the name of Shepherdson. \\ufffdThey was as high-toned\\nand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. \\ufffdThe\\nShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was\\nabout two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a\\nlot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their\\nfine horses.\\n\\nOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\\ncoming. \\ufffdWe was crossing the road. \\ufffdBuck says:\\n\\n\"Quick! \\ufffdJump for the woods!\"\\n\\nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. \\ufffdPretty\\nsoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his\\nhorse easy and looking like a soldier. \\ufffdHe had his gun across his\\npommel. \\ufffdI had seen him before. \\ufffdIt was young Harney Shepherdson. \\ufffdI\\nheard Buck\\'s gun go off at my ear, and Harney\\'s hat tumbled off from his\\nhead. \\ufffdHe grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was\\nhid. \\ufffdBut we didn\\'t wait. \\ufffdWe started through the woods on a run. \\ufffdThe\\nwoods warn\\'t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,\\nand twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away\\nthe way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\\'t see. \\ufffdWe never\\nstopped running till we got home. \\ufffdThe old gentleman\\'s eyes blazed a\\nminute--\\'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed\\ndown, and he says, kind of gentle:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like that shooting from behind a bush. \\ufffdWhy didn\\'t you step\\ninto the road, my boy?\"\\n\\n\"The Shepherdsons don\\'t, father. \\ufffdThey always take advantage.\"\\n\\nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\\nhis tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. \\ufffdThe two young\\nmen looked dark, but never said nothing. \\ufffdMiss Sophia she turned pale,\\nbut the color come back when she found the man warn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\\nourselves, I says:\\n\\n\"Did you want to kill him, Buck?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I bet I did.\"\\n\\n\"What did he do to you?\"\\n\\n\"Him? \\ufffdHe never done nothing to me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?\"\\n\\n\"Why, nothing--only it\\'s on account of the feud.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s a feud?\"\\n\\n\"Why, where was you raised? \\ufffdDon\\'t you know what a feud is?\"\\n\\n\"Never heard of it before--tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says Buck, \"a feud is this way: \\ufffdA man has a quarrel with\\nanother man, and kills him; then that other man\\'s brother kills _him_;\\nthen the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\\n_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody\\'s killed off, and there ain\\'t\\nno more feud. \\ufffdBut it\\'s kind of slow, and takes a long time.\"\\n\\n\"Has this one been going on long, Buck?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I should _reckon_! \\ufffdIt started thirty year ago, or som\\'ers along\\nthere. \\ufffdThere was trouble \\'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle\\nit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the\\nman that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course. \\ufffdAnybody\\nwould.\"\\n\\n\"What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?\"\\n\\n\"I reckon maybe--I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, who done the shooting? \\ufffdWas it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\"\\n\\n\"Laws, how do I know? \\ufffdIt was so long ago.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t anybody know?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they\\ndon\\'t know now what the row was about in the first place.\"\\n\\n\"Has there been many killed, Buck?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; right smart chance of funerals. \\ufffdBut they don\\'t always kill. \\ufffdPa\\'s\\ngot a few buckshot in him; but he don\\'t mind it \\'cuz he don\\'t weigh\\nmuch, anyway. \\ufffdBob\\'s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom\\'s been\\nhurt once or twice.\"\\n\\n\"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; we got one and they got one. \\ufffd\\'Bout three months ago my cousin\\nBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t\\'other side\\nof the river, and didn\\'t have no weapon with him, which was blame\\'\\nfoolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind\\nhim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin\\' after him with his gun in\\nhis hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and \\'stead of jumping\\noff and taking to the brush, Bud \\'lowed he could out-run him; so they\\nhad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all\\nthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn\\'t any use, so he stopped and faced\\naround so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old\\nman he rode up and shot him down. \\ufffdBut he didn\\'t git much chance to\\nenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon he _warn\\'t_ a coward. \\ufffdNot by a blame\\' sight. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t a\\ncoward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one. \\ufffdAnd there ain\\'t no cowards\\namongst the Grangerfords either. \\ufffdWhy, that old man kep\\' up his end in a\\nfight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come\\nout winner. \\ufffdThey was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got\\nbehind a little woodpile, and kep\\' his horse before him to stop the\\nbullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around\\nthe old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.\\n\\ufffdHim and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the\\nGrangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of \\'em was dead, and\\nanother died the next day. \\ufffdNo, sir; if a body\\'s out hunting for cowards\\nhe don\\'t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz\\nthey don\\'t breed any of that _kind_.\"\\n\\nNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\\na-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept\\nthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. \\ufffdThe\\nShepherdsons done the same. \\ufffdIt was pretty ornery preaching--all about\\nbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\\na good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\\na powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\\npreforeordestination, and I don\\'t know what all, that it did seem to me\\nto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\\n\\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\\nchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. \\ufffdBuck and\\na dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. \\ufffdI went up\\nto our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. \\ufffdI found that sweet\\nMiss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took\\nme in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,\\nand I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and\\nnot tell anybody, and I said I would. \\ufffdThen she said she\\'d forgot her\\nTestament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,\\nand would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\\nnothing to nobody. \\ufffdI said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\\nroad, and there warn\\'t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,\\nfor there warn\\'t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\\nin summer-time because it\\'s cool. \\ufffdIf you notice, most folks don\\'t go to\\nchurch only when they\\'ve got to; but a hog is different.\\n\\nSays I to myself, something\\'s up; it ain\\'t natural for a girl to be in\\nsuch a sweat about a Testament. \\ufffdSo I give it a shake, and out drops a\\nlittle piece of paper with \"HALF-PAST TWO\" wrote on it with a pencil. \\ufffdI\\nransacked it, but couldn\\'t find anything else. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t make anything\\nout of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home\\nand upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. \\ufffdShe\\npulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till\\nshe found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and\\nbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and\\nsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. \\ufffdShe was\\nmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\\nmade her powerful pretty. \\ufffdI was a good deal astonished, but when I got\\nmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I\\nhad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,\\nand I told her \"no, only coarse-hand,\" and then she said the paper\\nwarn\\'t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and\\nplay now.\\n\\nI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\\nI noticed that my nigger was following along behind. \\ufffdWhen we was out\\nof sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\\na-running, and says:\\n\\n\"Mars Jawge, if you\\'ll come down into de swamp I\\'ll show you a whole\\nstack o\\' water-moccasins.\"\\n\\nThinks I, that\\'s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. \\ufffdHe oughter\\nknow a body don\\'t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for\\nthem. What is he up to, anyway? \\ufffdSo I says:\\n\\n\"All right; trot ahead.\"\\n\\nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\\nankle deep as much as another half-mile. \\ufffdWe come to a little flat piece\\nof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\\nand he says:\\n\\n\"You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah\\'s whah dey is.\\nI\\'s seed \\'m befo\\'; I don\\'t k\\'yer to see \\'em no mo\\'.\"\\n\\nThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid\\nhim. \\ufffdI poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch\\nas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying\\nthere asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\\n\\nI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to\\nhim to see me again, but it warn\\'t. \\ufffdHe nearly cried he was so glad, but\\nhe warn\\'t surprised. \\ufffdSaid he swum along behind me that night, and heard\\nme yell every time, but dasn\\'t answer, because he didn\\'t want nobody to\\npick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. \\ufffdSays he:\\n\\n\"I got hurt a little, en couldn\\'t swim fas\\', so I wuz a considable ways\\nbehine you towards de las\\'; when you landed I reck\\'ned I could ketch\\nup wid you on de lan\\' \\'dout havin\\' to shout at you, but when I see dat\\nhouse I begin to go slow. \\ufffdI \\'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to\\nyou--I wuz \\'fraid o\\' de dogs; but when it \\'uz all quiet agin I knowed\\nyou\\'s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. \\ufffdEarly\\nin de mawnin\\' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey\\ntuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can\\'t track me on accounts\\no\\' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how\\nyou\\'s a-gitt\\'n along.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Well, \\'twarn\\'t no use to \\'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but\\nwe\\'s all right now. \\ufffdI ben a-buyin\\' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a\\nchanst, en a-patchin\\' up de raf\\' nights when--\"\\n\\n\"_What_ raft, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Our ole raf\\'.\"\\n\\n\"You mean to say our old raft warn\\'t smashed all to flinders?\"\\n\\n\"No, she warn\\'t. \\ufffdShe was tore up a good deal--one en\\' of her was; but\\ndey warn\\'t no great harm done, on\\'y our traps was mos\\' all los\\'. \\ufffdEf we\\nhadn\\' dive\\' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn\\' ben\\nso dark, en we warn\\'t so sk\\'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin\\'\\nis, we\\'d a seed de raf\\'. \\ufffdBut it\\'s jis\\' as well we didn\\'t, \\'kase now\\nshe\\'s all fixed up agin mos\\' as good as new, en we\\'s got a new lot o\\'\\nstuff, in de place o\\' what \\'uz los\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?\"\\n\\n\"How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? \\ufffdNo; some er de niggers\\nfoun\\' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben\\', en dey hid her in a\\ncrick \\'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin\\' \\'bout which un \\'um\\nshe b\\'long to de mos\\' dat I come to heah \\'bout it pooty soon, so I ups\\nen settles de trouble by tellin\\' \\'um she don\\'t b\\'long to none uv um, but\\nto you en me; en I ast \\'m if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman\\'s\\npropaty, en git a hid\\'n for it? \\ufffdDen I gin \\'m ten cents apiece, en dey\\n\\'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo\\' raf\\'s \\'ud come along en\\nmake \\'m rich agin. Dey\\'s mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever\\nI wants \\'m to do fur me I doan\\' have to ast \\'m twice, honey. \\ufffdDat Jack\\'s\\na good nigger, en pooty smart.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he is. \\ufffdHe ain\\'t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and\\nhe\\'d show me a lot of water-moccasins. \\ufffdIf anything happens _he_ ain\\'t\\nmixed up in it. \\ufffdHe can say he never seen us together, and it \\'ll be the\\ntruth.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t want to talk much about the next day. \\ufffdI reckon I\\'ll cut it\\npretty short. \\ufffdI waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and\\ngo to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn\\'t seem to be\\nanybody stirring. \\ufffdThat warn\\'t usual. \\ufffdNext I noticed that Buck was\\nup and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody\\naround; everything as still as a mouse. \\ufffdJust the same outside. \\ufffdThinks\\nI, what does it mean? \\ufffdDown by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"What\\'s it all about?\"\\n\\nSays he:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know, Mars Jawge?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" says I, \"I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Well, den, Miss Sophia\\'s run off! \\'deed she has. \\ufffdShe run off in de\\nnight some time--nobody don\\'t know jis\\' when; run off to get married\\nto dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey \\'spec. \\ufffdDe\\nfambly foun\\' it out \\'bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo\\'--en\\' I\\n_tell_ you dey warn\\'t no time los\\'. \\ufffdSich another hurryin\\' up guns\\nen hosses _you_ never see! \\ufffdDe women folks has gone for to stir up de\\nrelations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de\\nriver road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him \\'fo\\' he kin\\ngit acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. \\ufffdI reck\\'n dey\\'s gwyne to be mighty\\nrough times.\"\\n\\n\"Buck went off \\'thout waking me up.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I reck\\'n he _did_! \\ufffdDey warn\\'t gwyne to mix you up in it.\\n\\ufffdMars Buck he loaded up his gun en \\'lowed he\\'s gwyne to fetch home a\\nShepherdson or bust. Well, dey\\'ll be plenty un \\'m dah, I reck\\'n, en you\\nbet you he\\'ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.\"\\n\\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. \\ufffdBy and by I begin to\\nhear guns a good ways off. \\ufffdWhen I come in sight of the log store and\\nthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees\\nand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the\\nforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. \\ufffdThere was a\\nwood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I\\nwas going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn\\'t.\\n\\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open\\nplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at\\na couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the\\nsteamboat landing; but they couldn\\'t come it. \\ufffdEvery time one of them\\nshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. \\ufffdThe\\ntwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch\\nboth ways.\\n\\nBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. \\ufffdThey started\\nriding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady\\nbead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. \\ufffdAll\\nthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started\\nto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the\\nrun. \\ufffdThey got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.\\nThen the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after\\nthem. \\ufffdThey gained on the boys, but it didn\\'t do no good, the boys had\\ntoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,\\nand slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.\\nOne of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about\\nnineteen years old.\\n\\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. \\ufffdAs soon as they was\\nout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. \\ufffdHe didn\\'t know what\\nto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. \\ufffdHe was awful\\nsurprised. \\ufffdHe told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the\\nmen come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or\\nother--wouldn\\'t be gone long. \\ufffdI wished I was out of that tree, but I\\ndasn\\'t come down. \\ufffdBuck begun to cry and rip, and \\'lowed that him and\\nhis cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this\\nday yet. \\ufffdHe said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two\\nor three of the enemy. \\ufffdSaid the Shepherdsons laid for them in\\nambush. \\ufffdBuck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their\\nrelations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. \\ufffdI asked him what\\nwas become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. \\ufffdHe said they\\'d got across\\nthe river and was safe. \\ufffdI was glad of that; but the way Buck did take\\non because he didn\\'t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I\\nhain\\'t ever heard anything like it.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had\\nslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their\\nhorses! \\ufffdThe boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they\\nswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and\\nsinging out, \"Kill them, kill them!\" \\ufffdIt made me so sick I most fell out\\nof the tree. \\ufffdI ain\\'t a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make\\nme sick again if I was to do that. \\ufffdI wished I hadn\\'t ever come ashore\\nthat night to see such things. \\ufffdI ain\\'t ever going to get shut of\\nthem--lots of times I dream about them.\\n\\nI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.\\nSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little\\ngangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the\\ntrouble was still a-going on. \\ufffdI was mighty downhearted; so I made up my\\nmind I wouldn\\'t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I\\nwas to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss\\nSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and\\nI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way\\nshe acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess\\nwouldn\\'t ever happened.\\n\\nWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a\\npiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and\\ntugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,\\nand got away as quick as I could. \\ufffdI cried a little when I was covering\\nup Buck\\'s face, for he was mighty good to me.\\n\\nIt was just dark now. \\ufffdI never went near the house, but struck through\\nthe woods and made for the swamp. \\ufffdJim warn\\'t on his island, so I\\ntramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,\\nred-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. \\ufffdThe raft was\\ngone! \\ufffdMy souls, but I was scared! \\ufffdI couldn\\'t get my breath for most\\na minute. Then I raised a yell. \\ufffdA voice not twenty-five foot from me\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Good lan\\'! is dat you, honey? \\ufffdDoan\\' make no noise.\"\\n\\nIt was Jim\\'s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before. \\ufffdI run along the\\nbank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was\\nso glad to see me. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Laws bless you, chile, I \\'uz right down sho\\' you\\'s dead agin. \\ufffdJack\\'s\\nbeen heah; he say he reck\\'n you\\'s ben shot, kase you didn\\' come home no\\nmo\\'; so I\\'s jes\\' dis minute a startin\\' de raf\\' down towards de mouf er\\nde crick, so\\'s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack\\ncomes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. \\ufffdLawsy, I\\'s mighty\\nglad to git you back again, honey.\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"All right--that\\'s mighty good; they won\\'t find me, and they\\'ll think\\nI\\'ve been killed, and floated down the river--there\\'s something up there\\nthat \\'ll help them think so--so don\\'t you lose no time, Jim, but just\\nshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.\"\\n\\nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in\\nthe middle of the Mississippi. \\ufffdThen we hung up our signal lantern, and\\njudged that we was free and safe once more. \\ufffdI hadn\\'t had a bite to eat\\nsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,\\nand pork and cabbage and greens--there ain\\'t nothing in the world so good\\nwhen it\\'s cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a\\ngood time. \\ufffdI was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was\\nJim to get away from the swamp. \\ufffdWe said there warn\\'t no home like a\\nraft, after all. \\ufffdOther places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a\\nraft don\\'t. \\ufffdYou feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nTWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\\nthey slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. \\ufffdHere is the way we put\\nin the time. \\ufffdIt was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\\nand a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\\nnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\\nin the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\\nwillows, and hid the raft with them. \\ufffdThen we set out the lines. \\ufffdNext\\nwe slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\\noff; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\\ndeep, and watched the daylight come. \\ufffdNot a sound anywheres--perfectly\\nstill--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\\na-cluttering, maybe. \\ufffdThe first thing to see, looking away over the\\nwater, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t\\'other side; you\\ncouldn\\'t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\\npaleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\\nwarn\\'t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\\ndrifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\\nlong black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\\njumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\\nby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\\nstreak that there\\'s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\\nand makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\\nof the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\\nlog-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t\\'other side of\\nthe river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\\nthrow a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\\ncomes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\\non account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\\nbecause they\\'ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\\ndo get pretty rank; and next you\\'ve got the full day, and everything\\nsmiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\\n\\nA little smoke couldn\\'t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\\nof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. \\ufffdAnd afterwards we would watch\\nthe lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\\nlazy off to sleep. \\ufffdWake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\\nmaybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\\nother side you couldn\\'t tell nothing about her only whether she was\\na stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn\\'t be\\nnothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness. \\ufffdNext\\nyou\\'d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\\nchopping, because they\\'re most always doing it on a raft; you\\'d see the\\naxe flash and come down--you don\\'t hear nothing; you see that axe go\\nup again, and by the time it\\'s above the man\\'s head then you hear the\\n_k\\'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water. \\ufffdSo we\\nwould put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. \\ufffdOnce\\nthere was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\\ntin pans so the steamboats wouldn\\'t run over them. \\ufffdA scow or a\\nraft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\\nlaughing--heard them plain; but we couldn\\'t see no sign of them; it made\\nyou feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.\\n\\ufffdJim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\\n\\n\"No; spirits wouldn\\'t say, \\'Dern the dern fog.\\'\"\\n\\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\\nmiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\\nher to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\\ntalked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\\nwhenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck\\'s folks made\\nfor me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn\\'t go much on\\nclothes, nohow.\\n\\nSometimes we\\'d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\\ntime. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\\na spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\\nyou could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\\nyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\\nIt\\'s lovely to live on a raft. \\ufffdWe had the sky up there, all speckled\\nwith stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\\ndiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened. \\ufffdJim he\\nallowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would\\nhave took too long to _make_ so many. \\ufffdJim said the moon could a _laid_\\nthem; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn\\'t say nothing\\nagainst it, because I\\'ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\\ncould be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\\nstreak down. \\ufffdJim allowed they\\'d got spoiled and was hove out of the\\nnest.\\n\\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\\ndark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\\nof her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\\npretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\\nher powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\\nwaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\\nraft a bit, and after that you wouldn\\'t hear nothing for you couldn\\'t\\ntell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\\n\\nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\\nthree hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\\n\\ufffdThese sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant\\nmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.\\n\\nOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\\nthe main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\\nup a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn\\'t get some\\nberries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed\\nthe crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\\nthey could foot it. \\ufffdI thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\\nafter anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. \\ufffdI was about to dig out\\nfrom there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung\\nout and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn\\'t been doing\\nnothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs\\na-coming. \\ufffdThey wanted to jump right in, but I says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you do it. \\ufffdI don\\'t hear the dogs and horses yet; you\\'ve got time\\nto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you\\ntake to the water and wade down to me and get in--that\\'ll throw the dogs\\noff the scent.\"\\n\\nThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\\nand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\\nshouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn\\'t\\nsee them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\\nfurther and further away all the time, we couldn\\'t hardly hear them at\\nall; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\\nriver, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid\\nin the cottonwoods and was safe.\\n\\nOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\\nand very gray whiskers. \\ufffdHe had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and\\na greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed\\ninto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. \\ufffdHe had\\nan old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over\\nhis arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\\n\\nThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. \\ufffdAfter\\nbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out\\nwas that these chaps didn\\'t know one another.\\n\\n\"What got you into trouble?\" says the baldhead to t\\'other chap.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and\\nit does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I\\nstayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act\\nof sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and\\nyou told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. \\ufffdSo\\nI told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_\\nyou. That\\'s the whole yarn--what\\'s yourn?\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d ben a-running\\' a little temperance revival thar \\'bout a week,\\nand was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin\\' it\\nmighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin\\' as much as five\\nor six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and\\nbusiness a-growin\\' all the time, when somehow or another a little report\\ngot around last night that I had a way of puttin\\' in my time with a\\nprivate jug on the sly. \\ufffdA nigger rousted me out this mornin\\', and told\\nme the people was getherin\\' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and\\nthey\\'d be along pretty soon and give me \\'bout half an hour\\'s start,\\nand then run me down if they could; and if they got me they\\'d tar\\nand feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. \\ufffdI didn\\'t wait for no\\nbreakfast--I warn\\'t hungry.\"\\n\\n\"Old man,\" said the young one, \"I reckon we might double-team it\\ntogether; what do you think?\"\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t undisposed. \\ufffdWhat\\'s your line--mainly?\"\\n\\n\"Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;\\ntheater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology\\nwhen there\\'s a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;\\nsling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that\\ncomes handy, so it ain\\'t work. \\ufffdWhat\\'s your lay?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. \\ufffdLayin\\' on o\\'\\nhands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I\\nk\\'n tell a fortune pretty good when I\\'ve got somebody along to find out\\nthe facts for me. \\ufffdPreachin\\'s my line, too, and workin\\' camp-meetin\\'s,\\nand missionaryin\\' around.\"\\n\\nNobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Alas!\"\\n\\n\"What \\'re you alassin\\' about?\" says the bald-head.\\n\\n\"To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded\\ndown into such company.\" \\ufffdAnd he begun to wipe the corner of his eye\\nwith a rag.\\n\\n\"Dern your skin, ain\\'t the company good enough for you?\" says the\\nbaldhead, pretty pert and uppish.\\n\\n\"Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it\\'s as good as I deserve; for who\\nfetched me so low when I was so high? \\ufffdI did myself. \\ufffdI don\\'t blame\\n_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don\\'t blame anybody. \\ufffdI deserve it\\nall. \\ufffdLet the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there\\'s a grave\\nsomewhere for me. The world may go on just as it\\'s always done, and take\\neverything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can\\'t take\\nthat. Some day I\\'ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken\\nheart will be at rest.\" \\ufffdHe went on a-wiping.\\n\\n\"Drot your pore broken heart,\" says the baldhead; \"what are you heaving\\nyour pore broken heart at _us_ f\\'r? \\ufffd_we_ hain\\'t done nothing.\"\\n\\n\"No, I know you haven\\'t. \\ufffdI ain\\'t blaming you, gentlemen. \\ufffdI brought\\nmyself down--yes, I did it myself. \\ufffdIt\\'s right I should suffer--perfectly\\nright--I don\\'t make any moan.\"\\n\\n\"Brought you down from whar? \\ufffdWhar was you brought down from?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--\\'tis\\nno matter. \\ufffdThe secret of my birth--\"\\n\\n\"The secret of your birth! \\ufffdDo you mean to say--\"\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" says the young man, very solemn, \"I will reveal it to you,\\nfor I feel I may have confidence in you. \\ufffdBy rights I am a duke!\"\\n\\nJim\\'s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.\\nThen the baldhead says: \\ufffd\"No! you can\\'t mean it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. \\ufffdMy great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled\\nto this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure\\nair of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father\\ndying about the same time. \\ufffdThe second son of the late duke seized the\\ntitles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored. \\ufffdI am the lineal\\ndescendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and\\nhere am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised\\nby the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the\\ncompanionship of felons on a raft!\"\\n\\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but\\nhe said it warn\\'t much use, he couldn\\'t be much comforted; said if we\\nwas a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most\\nanything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. \\ufffdHe said we\\nought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \"Your Grace,\" or \"My Lord,\"\\nor \"Your Lordship\"--and he wouldn\\'t mind it if we called him plain\\n\"Bridgewater,\" which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and\\none of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for\\nhim he wanted done.\\n\\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. \\ufffdAll through dinner Jim stood\\naround and waited on him, and says, \"Will yo\\' Grace have some o\\' dis or\\nsome o\\' dat?\" and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to\\nhim.\\n\\nBut the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn\\'t have much to say, and\\ndidn\\'t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on\\naround that duke. \\ufffdHe seemed to have something on his mind. \\ufffdSo, along\\nin the afternoon, he says:\\n\\n\"Looky here, Bilgewater,\" he says, \"I\\'m nation sorry for you, but you\\nain\\'t the only person that\\'s had troubles like that.\"\\n\\n\"No?\"\\n\\n\"No you ain\\'t. \\ufffdYou ain\\'t the only person that\\'s ben snaked down\\nwrongfully out\\'n a high place.\"\\n\\n\"Alas!\"\\n\\n\"No, you ain\\'t the only person that\\'s had a secret of his birth.\" \\ufffdAnd,\\nby jings, _he_ begins to cry.\\n\\n\"Hold! \\ufffdWhat do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?\" says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\\n\\n\"To the bitter death!\" \\ufffdHe took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,\\nand says, \"That secret of your being: \\ufffdspeak!\"\\n\\n\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\"\\n\\nYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time. \\ufffdThen the duke says:\\n\\n\"You are what?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin\\' at this very moment\\non the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the\\nSixteen and Marry Antonette.\"\\n\\n\"You! \\ufffdAt your age! \\ufffdNo! \\ufffdYou mean you\\'re the late Charlemagne; you must\\nbe six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.\"\\n\\n\"Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung\\nthese gray hairs and this premature balditude. \\ufffdYes, gentlemen, you\\nsee before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin\\', exiled,\\ntrampled-on, and sufferin\\' rightful King of France.\"\\n\\nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn\\'t know hardly what to\\ndo, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we\\'d got him with us, too.\\n\\ufffdSo we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort\\n_him_. But he said it warn\\'t no use, nothing but to be dead and done\\nwith it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel\\neasier and better for a while if people treated him according to his\\nrights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him\\n\"Your Majesty,\" and waited on him first at meals, and didn\\'t set down\\nin his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,\\nand doing this and that and t\\'other for him, and standing up till he\\ntold us we might set down. \\ufffdThis done him heaps of good, and so he\\ngot cheerful and comfortable. \\ufffdBut the duke kind of soured on him, and\\ndidn\\'t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,\\nthe king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke\\'s\\ngreat-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good\\ndeal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace\\nconsiderable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the\\nking says:\\n\\n\"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\\nraft, Bilgewater, and so what\\'s the use o\\' your bein\\' sour? \\ufffdIt \\'ll only\\nmake things oncomfortable. \\ufffdIt ain\\'t my fault I warn\\'t born a duke,\\nit ain\\'t your fault you warn\\'t born a king--so what\\'s the use to worry?\\n\\ufffdMake the best o\\' things the way you find \\'em, says I--that\\'s my motto.\\n\\ufffdThis ain\\'t no bad thing that we\\'ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy\\nlife--come, give us your hand, duke, and le\\'s all be friends.\"\\n\\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. \\ufffdIt took\\naway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because\\nit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the\\nraft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody\\nto be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn\\'t no\\nkings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. \\ufffdBut I\\nnever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it\\'s the best way;\\nthen you don\\'t have no quarrels, and don\\'t get into no trouble. \\ufffdIf they\\nwanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn\\'t no objections, \\'long as\\nit would keep peace in the family; and it warn\\'t no use to tell Jim, so\\nI didn\\'t tell him. \\ufffdIf I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt\\nthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them\\nhave their own way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\nTHEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we\\ncovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of\\nrunning--was Jim a runaway nigger? \\ufffdSays I:\\n\\n\"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\"\\n\\nNo, they allowed he wouldn\\'t. \\ufffdI had to account for things some way, so\\nI says:\\n\\n\"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\\nthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. \\ufffdPa, he \\'lowed\\nhe\\'d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who\\'s got a little\\none-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. \\ufffdPa was\\npretty poor, and had some debts; so when he\\'d squared up there warn\\'t\\nnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. \\ufffdThat warn\\'t\\nenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\\n\\ufffdWell, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\\nthis piece of a raft; so we reckoned we\\'d go down to Orleans on it.\\n\\ufffdPa\\'s luck didn\\'t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\\nthe raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\\nJim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\\nyears old, so they never come up no more. \\ufffdWell, for the next day or\\ntwo we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\\nskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\\na runaway nigger. \\ufffdWe don\\'t run daytimes no more now; nights they don\\'t\\nbother us.\"\\n\\nThe duke says:\\n\\n\"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\\nwant to. \\ufffdI\\'ll think the thing over--I\\'ll invent a plan that\\'ll fix it.\\nWe\\'ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don\\'t want to go by\\nthat town yonder in daylight--it mightn\\'t be healthy.\"\\n\\nTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\\nlightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\\nbeginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\\nthat. \\ufffdSo the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\\nwhat the beds was like. \\ufffdMy bed was a straw tick better than Jim\\'s,\\nwhich was a corn-shuck tick; there\\'s always cobs around about in a shuck\\ntick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\\nshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\\nmakes such a rustling that you wake up. \\ufffdWell, the duke allowed he would\\ntake my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn\\'t. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that\\na corn-shuck bed warn\\'t just fitten for me to sleep on. \\ufffdYour Grace \\'ll\\ntake the shuck bed yourself.\"\\n\\nJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was\\ngoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when\\nthe duke says:\\n\\n\"\\'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\\noppression. \\ufffdMisfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I\\nsubmit; \\'tis my fate. \\ufffdI am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear\\nit.\"\\n\\nWe got away as soon as it was good and dark. \\ufffdThe king told us to stand\\nwell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\\ngot a long ways below the town. \\ufffdWe come in sight of the little bunch of\\nlights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half\\na mile out, all right. \\ufffdWhen we was three-quarters of a mile below we\\nhoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o\\'clock it come on to rain\\nand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\\nto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\\ncrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. \\ufffdIt was my watch\\nbelow till twelve, but I wouldn\\'t a turned in anyway if I\\'d had a bed,\\nbecause a body don\\'t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\\nby a long sight. \\ufffdMy souls, how the wind did scream along! \\ufffdAnd every\\nsecond or two there\\'d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\\na mile around, and you\\'d see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\\nand the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\\nbum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\\nand grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\\nanother sockdolager. \\ufffdThe waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\\nbut I hadn\\'t any clothes on, and didn\\'t mind. \\ufffdWe didn\\'t have no trouble\\nabout snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\\nthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or\\nthat and miss them.\\n\\nI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\\nso Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\\nmighty good that way, Jim was. \\ufffdI crawled into the wigwam, but the king\\nand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn\\'t no show for\\nme; so I laid outside--I didn\\'t mind the rain, because it was warm, and\\nthe waves warn\\'t running so high now. \\ufffdAbout two they come up again,\\nthough, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\\nhe reckoned they warn\\'t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\\nmistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\\nregular ripper and washed me overboard. \\ufffdIt most killed Jim a-laughing.\\n\\ufffdHe was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\\n\\nI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\\nthe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed\\nI rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the\\nday.\\n\\nThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him\\nand the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. \\ufffdThen they got\\ntired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign,\" as they called\\nit. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of\\nlittle printed bills and read them out loud. \\ufffdOne bill said, \"The\\ncelebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\" would \"lecture on the\\nScience of Phrenology\" at such and such a place, on the blank day of\\nblank, at ten cents admission, and \"furnish charts of character at\\ntwenty-five cents apiece.\" \\ufffdThe duke said that was _him_. \\ufffdIn another\\nbill he was the \"world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the\\nYounger, of Drury Lane, London.\" \\ufffdIn other bills he had a lot of other\\nnames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with\\na \"divining-rod,\" \"dissipating witch spells,\" and so on. \\ufffdBy and by he\\nsays:\\n\\n\"But the histrionic muse is the darling. \\ufffdHave you ever trod the boards,\\nRoyalty?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" says the king.\\n\\n\"You shall, then, before you\\'re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\" says\\nthe duke. \\ufffd\"The first good town we come to we\\'ll hire a hall and do the\\nsword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.\\nHow does that strike you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you\\nsee, I don\\'t know nothing about play-actin\\', and hain\\'t ever seen much\\nof it. \\ufffdI was too small when pap used to have \\'em at the palace. \\ufffdDo you\\nreckon you can learn me?\"\\n\\n\"Easy!\"\\n\\n\"All right. \\ufffdI\\'m jist a-freezn\\' for something fresh, anyway. \\ufffdLe\\'s\\ncommence right away.\"\\n\\nSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and\\nsaid he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\\n\\n\"But if Juliet\\'s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white\\nwhiskers is goin\\' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\"\\n\\n\"No, don\\'t you worry; these country jakes won\\'t ever think of that.\\nBesides, you know, you\\'ll be in costume, and that makes all the\\ndifference in the world; Juliet\\'s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\\nbefore she goes to bed, and she\\'s got on her night-gown and her ruffled\\nnightcap. \\ufffdHere are the costumes for the parts.\"\\n\\nHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\\nmeedyevil armor for Richard III. and t\\'other chap, and a long white\\ncotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. \\ufffdThe king was\\nsatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\\nmost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\\ntime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\\nking and told him to get his part by heart.\\n\\nThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\\nafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\\nin daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\\ngo down to the town and fix that thing. \\ufffdThe king allowed he would go,\\ntoo, and see if he couldn\\'t strike something. \\ufffdWe was out of coffee, so\\nJim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\\n\\nWhen we got there there warn\\'t nobody stirring; streets empty, and\\nperfectly dead and still, like Sunday. \\ufffdWe found a sick nigger sunning\\nhimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn\\'t too young or\\ntoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\\nwoods. \\ufffdThe king got the directions, and allowed he\\'d go and work that\\ncamp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\\n\\nThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office. \\ufffdWe found it;\\na little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and\\nprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. \\ufffdIt was a dirty,\\nlittered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\\nhorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. \\ufffdThe duke shed\\nhis coat and said he was all right now. \\ufffdSo me and the king lit out for\\nthe camp-meeting.\\n\\nWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\\nawful hot day. \\ufffdThere was as much as a thousand people there from\\ntwenty mile around. \\ufffdThe woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\\neverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\\noff the flies. \\ufffdThere was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\\nbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\\nwatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\\n\\nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\\nbigger and held crowds of people. \\ufffdThe benches was made out of outside\\nslabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\\nfor legs. They didn\\'t have no backs. \\ufffdThe preachers had high platforms\\nto stand on at one end of the sheds. \\ufffdThe women had on sun-bonnets;\\nand some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\\nyoung ones had on calico. \\ufffdSome of the young men was barefooted, and\\nsome of the children didn\\'t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\\nshirt. \\ufffdSome of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\\nwas courting on the sly.\\n\\nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. \\ufffdHe lined\\nout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\\nthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\\nhe lined out two more for them to sing--and so on. \\ufffdThe people woke up\\nmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\\nbegun to groan, and some begun to shout. \\ufffdThen the preacher begun to\\npreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\\nthe platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\\nof it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\\nwords out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\\nhis Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\\nthat, shouting, \"It\\'s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! \\ufffdLook upon\\nit and live!\" \\ufffdAnd people would shout out, \"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\" \\ufffdAnd so\\nhe went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\\n\\n\"Oh, come to the mourners\\' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\\nsick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\\npore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that\\'s worn and\\nsoiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\\nheart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\\nis free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!\"\\n(_A-A-Men_! \\ufffd_Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\\n\\nAnd so on. \\ufffdYou couldn\\'t make out what the preacher said any more, on\\naccount of the shouting and crying. \\ufffdFolks got up everywheres in the\\ncrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners\\'\\nbench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\\nmourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\\nshouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\\n\\nWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\\nover everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\\nthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. \\ufffdHe\\ntold them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\\nIndian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\\na fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\\ngoodness he\\'d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\\nwithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\\never happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\\nthe first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\\nright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\\nof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\\ndo it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\\nin that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\\nwithout money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced\\na pirate he would say to him, \"Don\\'t you thank me, don\\'t you give me no\\ncredit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,\\nnatural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher\\nthere, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\"\\n\\nAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. \\ufffdThen somebody\\nsings out, \"Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!\" \\ufffdWell,\\na half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \"Let _him_\\npass the hat around!\" \\ufffdThen everybody said it, the preacher too.\\n\\nSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,\\nand blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being\\nso good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the\\nprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would\\nup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he\\nalways done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or\\nsix times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to\\nlive in their houses, and said they\\'d think it was an honor; but he said\\nas this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn\\'t do no good, and\\nbesides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\\nwork on the pirates.\\n\\nWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\\ncollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. \\ufffdAnd then he had\\nfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\\nwagon when he was starting home through the woods. \\ufffdThe king said,\\ntake it all around, it laid over any day he\\'d ever put in in the\\nmissionarying line. \\ufffdHe said it warn\\'t no use talking, heathens don\\'t\\namount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\\n\\nThe duke was thinking _he\\'d_ been doing pretty well till the king come\\nto show up, but after that he didn\\'t think so so much. \\ufffdHe had set\\nup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\\nprinting-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. \\ufffdAnd he\\nhad got in ten dollars\\' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he\\nsaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so\\nthey done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took\\nin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them\\npaying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as\\nusual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the\\nprice as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\\n\\ufffdHe set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of\\nhis own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,\\n\"Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart\"--and he left that all set\\nup and ready to print in the paper, and didn\\'t charge nothing for it.\\n\\ufffdWell, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he\\'d done a pretty\\nsquare day\\'s work for it.\\n\\nThen he showed us another little job he\\'d printed and hadn\\'t charged\\nfor, because it was for us. \\ufffdIt had a picture of a runaway nigger with\\na bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \"$200 reward\" under it. \\ufffdThe\\nreading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. \\ufffdIt said\\nhe run away from St. Jacques\\' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\\nlast winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send\\nhim back he could have the reward and expenses.\\n\\n\"Now,\" says the duke, \"after to-night we can run in the daytime if we\\nwant to. \\ufffdWhenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot\\nwith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we\\ncaptured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,\\nso we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down\\nto get the reward. \\ufffdHandcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,\\nbut it wouldn\\'t go well with the story of us being so poor. \\ufffdToo much\\nlike jewelry. \\ufffdRopes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,\\nas we say on the boards.\"\\n\\nWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn\\'t be no trouble\\nabout running daytimes. \\ufffdWe judged we could make miles enough that night\\nto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke\\'s work in\\nthe printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could\\nboom right along if we wanted to.\\n\\nWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten\\no\\'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn\\'t\\nhoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\\n\\nWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:\\n\\n\"Huck, does you reck\\'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo\\' kings on dis\\ntrip?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I says, \"I reckon not.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says he, \"dat\\'s all right, den. \\ufffdI doan\\' mine one er two kings,\\nbut dat\\'s enough. \\ufffdDis one\\'s powerful drunk, en de duke ain\\' much\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear\\nwhat it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and\\nhad so much trouble, he\\'d forgot it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\nIT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn\\'t tie up. \\ufffdThe\\nking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after\\nthey\\'d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good\\ndeal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,\\nand pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs\\ndangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went\\nto getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. \\ufffdWhen he had got it pretty\\ngood him and the duke begun to practice it together. \\ufffdThe duke had to\\nlearn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him\\nsigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done\\nit pretty well; \"only,\" he says, \"you mustn\\'t bellow out _Romeo_!\\nthat way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,\\nso--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet\\'s a dear sweet mere child of\\na girl, you know, and she doesn\\'t bray like a jackass.\"\\n\\nWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out\\nof oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called\\nhimself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around\\nthe raft was grand to see. \\ufffdBut by and by the king tripped and fell\\noverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all\\nkinds of adventures they\\'d had in other times along the river.\\n\\nAfter dinner the duke says:\\n\\n\"Well, Capet, we\\'ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so\\nI guess we\\'ll add a little more to it. \\ufffdWe want a little something to\\nanswer encores with, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s onkores, Bilgewater?\"\\n\\nThe duke told him, and then says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor\\'s hornpipe; and\\nyou--well, let me see--oh, I\\'ve got it--you can do Hamlet\\'s soliloquy.\"\\n\\n\"Hamlet\\'s which?\"\\n\\n\"Hamlet\\'s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.\\nAh, it\\'s sublime, sublime! \\ufffdAlways fetches the house. \\ufffdI haven\\'t got\\nit in the book--I\\'ve only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out\\nfrom memory. \\ufffdI\\'ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call\\nit back from recollection\\'s vaults.\"\\n\\nSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible\\nevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would\\nsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next\\nhe would sigh, and next he\\'d let on to drop a tear. \\ufffdIt was beautiful\\nto see him. By and by he got it. \\ufffdHe told us to give attention. \\ufffdThen\\nhe strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his\\narms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;\\nand then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,\\nall through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his\\nchest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.\\n\\ufffdThis is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it\\nto the king:\\n\\nTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of\\nso long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come\\nto Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the\\ninnocent sleep, Great nature\\'s second course, And makes us rather sling\\nthe arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.\\nThere\\'s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I\\nwould thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The\\noppressor\\'s wrong, the proud man\\'s contumely, The law\\'s delay, and the\\nquietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the\\nnight, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But\\nthat the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,\\nBreathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of\\nresolution, like the poor cat i\\' the adage, Is sicklied o\\'er with care.\\nAnd all the clouds that lowered o\\'er our housetops, With this\\nregard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. \\'Tis a\\nconsummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope\\nnot thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!\\n\\nWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he\\ncould do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when\\nhe had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he\\nwould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.\\n\\nThe first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and\\nafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a\\nmost uncommon lively place, for there warn\\'t nothing but sword-fighting\\nand rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,\\nwhen we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight\\nof a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about\\nthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was\\nshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took\\nthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that\\nplace for our show.\\n\\nWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that\\nafternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in\\nall kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave\\nbefore night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he\\nhired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills.

The houses had little\\ngardens around them, but they didn\\'t seem to raise hardly anything in\\nthem but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up\\nboots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out\\ntin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on\\nat different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that\\ndidn\\'t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences\\nhad been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in\\nClumbus\\'s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and\\npeople driving them out.\\n\\nAll the stores was along one street. \\ufffdThey had white domestic awnings in\\nfront, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.\\nThere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting\\non them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and\\nchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery\\nlot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,\\nbut didn\\'t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,\\nand Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and\\nused considerable many cuss words. \\ufffdThere was as many as one loafer\\nleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands\\nin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw\\nof tobacco or scratch. \\ufffdWhat a body was hearing amongst them all the\\ntime was:\\n\\n\"Gimme a chaw \\'v tobacker, Hank.\"\\n\\n\"Cain\\'t; I hain\\'t got but one chaw left. \\ufffdAsk Bill.\"\\n\\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain\\'t got\\nnone. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a\\nchaw of tobacco of their own. \\ufffdThey get all their chawing by borrowing;\\nthey say to a fellow, \"I wisht you\\'d len\\' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this\\nminute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had\"--which is a lie pretty\\nmuch everytime; it don\\'t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain\\'t no\\nstranger, so he says:\\n\\n\"_You_ give him a chaw, did you? \\ufffdSo did your sister\\'s cat\\'s\\ngrandmother. You pay me back the chaws you\\'ve awready borry\\'d off\\'n me,\\nLafe Buckner, then I\\'ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won\\'t charge\\nyou no back intrust, nuther.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you did--\\'bout six chaws. \\ufffdYou borry\\'d store tobacker and paid back\\nnigger-head.\"\\n\\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the\\nnatural leaf twisted. \\ufffdWhen they borrow a chaw they don\\'t generly cut it\\noff with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with\\ntheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in\\ntwo; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it\\nwhen it\\'s handed back, and says, sarcastic:\\n\\n\"Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.\"\\n\\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn\\'t nothing else _but_\\nmud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,\\nand two or three inches deep in _all_ the places. \\ufffdThe hogs loafed and\\ngrunted around everywheres. \\ufffdYou\\'d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs\\ncome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,\\nwhere folks had to walk around her, and she\\'d stretch out and shut her\\neyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as\\nhappy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you\\'d hear a loafer\\nsing out, \"Hi! \\ufffd_so_ boy! sick him, Tige!\" and away the sow would go,\\nsquealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and\\nthree or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the\\nloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun\\nand look grateful for the noise. \\ufffdThen they\\'d settle back again till\\nthere was a dog fight. \\ufffdThere couldn\\'t anything wake them up all over,\\nand make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be\\nputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a\\ntin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\\n\\nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,\\nand they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people\\nhad moved out of them. \\ufffdThe bank was caved away under one corner of some\\nothers, and that corner was hanging over. \\ufffdPeople lived in them yet, but\\nit was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house\\ncaves in at a time. \\ufffdSometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep\\nwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the\\nriver in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,\\nand back, and back, because the river\\'s always gnawing at it.\\n\\nThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the\\nwagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.\\n\\ufffdFamilies fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them\\nin the wagons. \\ufffdThere was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I\\nseen three fights. \\ufffdBy and by somebody sings out:\\n\\n\"Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly\\ndrunk; here he comes, boys!\"\\n\\nAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out\\nof Boggs. \\ufffdOne of them says:\\n\\n\"Wonder who he\\'s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. \\ufffdIf he\\'d a-chawed up all\\nthe men he\\'s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he\\'d have\\nconsiderable ruputation now.\"\\n\\nAnother one says, \"I wisht old Boggs \\'d threaten me, \\'cuz then I\\'d know\\nI warn\\'t gwyne to die for a thousan\\' year.\"\\n\\nBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an\\nInjun, and singing out:\\n\\n\"Cler the track, thar. \\ufffdI\\'m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is\\na-gwyne to raise.\"\\n\\nHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year\\nold, and had a very red face. \\ufffdEverybody yelled at him and laughed at\\nhim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he\\'d attend to them and\\nlay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn\\'t wait now because\\nhe\\'d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, \"Meat\\nfirst, and spoon vittles to top off on.\"\\n\\nHe see me, and rode up and says:\\n\\n\"Whar\\'d you come f\\'m, boy? \\ufffdYou prepared to die?\"\\n\\nThen he rode on. \\ufffdI was scared, but a man says:\\n\\n\"He don\\'t mean nothing; he\\'s always a-carryin\\' on like that when he\\'s\\ndrunk. \\ufffdHe\\'s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,\\ndrunk nor sober.\"\\n\\nBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down\\nso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:\\n\\n\"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you\\'ve swindled.\\nYou\\'re the houn\\' I\\'m after, and I\\'m a-gwyne to have you, too!\"\\n\\nAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue\\nto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and\\ngoing on. \\ufffdBy and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a\\nheap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and\\nthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come. \\ufffdHe says to Boggs,\\nmighty ca\\'m and slow--he says:\\n\\n\"I\\'m tired of this, but I\\'ll endure it till one o\\'clock. \\ufffdTill one\\no\\'clock, mind--no longer. \\ufffdIf you open your mouth against me only once\\nafter that time you can\\'t travel so far but I will find you.\"\\n\\nThen he turns and goes in. \\ufffdThe crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\\nstirred, and there warn\\'t no more laughing. \\ufffdBoggs rode off\\nblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\\nand pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping\\nit up. \\ufffdSome men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,\\nbut he wouldn\\'t; they told him it would be one o\\'clock in about fifteen\\nminutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away. \\ufffdBut it didn\\'t\\ndo no good. \\ufffdHe cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\\nin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\\nthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get\\na chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they\\ncould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn\\'t no use--up the street\\nhe would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. \\ufffdBy and by\\nsomebody says:\\n\\n\"Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he\\'ll listen\\nto her. \\ufffdIf anybody can persuade him, she can.\"\\n\\nSo somebody started on a run. \\ufffdI walked down street a ways and stopped.\\nIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his\\nhorse. \\ufffdHe was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with\\na friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.\\nHe was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn\\'t hanging back any, but was\\ndoing some of the hurrying himself. \\ufffdSomebody sings out:\\n\\n\"Boggs!\"\\n\\nI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\\nSherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a\\npistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with\\nthe barrel tilted up towards the sky. \\ufffdThe same second I see a young\\ngirl coming on the run, and two men with her. \\ufffdBoggs and the men turned\\nround to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men\\njumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to\\na level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,\\n\"O Lord, don\\'t shoot!\" \\ufffdBang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\\nclawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\\non to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. \\ufffdThat young\\ngirl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her\\nfather, crying, and saying, \"Oh, he\\'s killed him, he\\'s killed him!\" \\ufffdThe\\ncrowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with\\ntheir necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to\\nshove them back and shouting, \"Back, back! give him air, give him air!\"\\n\\nColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned\\naround on his heels and walked off.\\n\\nThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just\\nthe same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\\nplace at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. \\ufffdThey\\nlaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened\\nanother one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt\\nfirst, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. \\ufffdHe made about a\\ndozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his\\nbreath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that\\nhe laid still; he was dead. \\ufffdThen they pulled his daughter away from\\nhim, screaming and crying, and took her off. \\ufffdShe was about sixteen, and\\nvery sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\\n\\nWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\\npushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people\\nthat had the places wouldn\\'t give them up, and folks behind them was\\nsaying all the time, \"Say, now, you\\'ve looked enough, you fellows;\\n\\'tain\\'t right and \\'tain\\'t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and\\nnever give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as\\nyou.\"\\n\\nThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe\\nthere was going to be trouble. \\ufffdThe streets was full, and everybody was\\nexcited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,\\nand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,\\nstretching their necks and listening. \\ufffdOne long, lanky man, with long\\nhair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a\\ncrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs\\nstood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from\\none place to t\\'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their\\nheads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\\nhands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with\\nhis cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had\\nstood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung\\nout, \"Boggs!\" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says\\n\"Bang!\" staggered backwards, says \"Bang!\" again, and fell down flat on\\nhis back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;\\nsaid it was just exactly the way it all happened. \\ufffdThen as much as a\\ndozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\\n\\nWell, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. \\ufffdIn about a\\nminute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and\\nsnatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\nTHEY swarmed up towards Sherburn\\'s house, a-whooping and raging like\\nInjuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped\\nto mush, and it was awful to see. \\ufffdChildren was heeling it ahead of the\\nmob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\\nthe road was full of women\\'s heads, and there was nigger boys in every\\ntree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the\\nmob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of\\nreach. \\ufffdLots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared\\nmost to death.\\n\\nThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn\\'s palings as thick as they could\\njam together, and you couldn\\'t hear yourself think for the noise. \\ufffdIt\\nwas a little twenty-foot yard. \\ufffdSome sung out \"Tear down the fence! tear\\ndown the fence!\" \\ufffdThen there was a racket of ripping and tearing and\\nsmashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to\\nroll in like a wave.\\n\\nJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,\\nwith a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly\\nca\\'m and deliberate, not saying a word. \\ufffdThe racket stopped, and the\\nwave sucked back.\\n\\nSherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down. \\ufffdThe\\nstillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. \\ufffdSherburn run his eye slow\\nalong the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to\\nout-gaze him, but they couldn\\'t; they dropped their eyes and looked\\nsneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant\\nkind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread\\nthat\\'s got sand in it.\\n\\nThen he says, slow and scornful:\\n\\n\"The idea of _you_ lynching anybody! \\ufffdIt\\'s amusing. \\ufffdThe idea of you\\nthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_! \\ufffdBecause you\\'re brave\\nenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along\\nhere, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a\\n_man_? \\ufffdWhy, a _man\\'s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as\\nlong as it\\'s daytime and you\\'re not behind him.\\n\\n\"Do I know you? \\ufffdI know you clear through. I was born and raised in the\\nSouth, and I\\'ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.\\nThe average man\\'s a coward. \\ufffdIn the North he lets anybody walk over him\\nthat wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.\\nIn the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men\\nin the daytime, and robbed the lot. \\ufffdYour newspapers call you a\\nbrave people so much that you think you are braver than any other\\npeople--whereas you\\'re just _as_ brave, and no braver. \\ufffdWhy don\\'t your\\njuries hang murderers? \\ufffdBecause they\\'re afraid the man\\'s friends will\\nshoot them in the back, in the dark--and it\\'s just what they _would_ do.\\n\\n\"So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a\\nhundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. \\ufffdYour mistake\\nis, that you didn\\'t bring a man with you; that\\'s one mistake, and the\\nother is that you didn\\'t come in the dark and fetch your masks. \\ufffdYou\\nbrought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn\\'t had him\\nto start you, you\\'d a taken it out in blowing.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t want to come. \\ufffdThe average man don\\'t like trouble and\\ndanger. _You_ don\\'t like trouble and danger. \\ufffdBut if only _half_ a\\nman--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts \\'Lynch him! lynch him!\\' you\\'re\\nafraid to back down--afraid you\\'ll be found out to be what you\\nare--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that\\nhalf-a-man\\'s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big\\nthings you\\'re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that\\'s\\nwhat an army is--a mob; they don\\'t fight with courage that\\'s born in\\nthem, but with courage that\\'s borrowed from their mass, and from their\\nofficers. \\ufffdBut a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_\\npitifulness. \\ufffdNow the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and\\ngo home and crawl in a hole. \\ufffdIf any real lynching\\'s going to be done it\\nwill be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they\\'ll\\nbring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along. \\ufffdNow _leave_--and take your\\nhalf-a-man with you\"--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking\\nit when he says this.\\n\\nThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing\\noff every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking\\ntolerable cheap. \\ufffdI could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn\\'t want to.\\n\\nI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman\\nwent by, and then dived in under the tent. \\ufffdI had my twenty-dollar gold\\npiece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because\\nthere ain\\'t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from\\nhome and amongst strangers that way. \\ufffdYou can\\'t be too careful. \\ufffdI ain\\'t\\nopposed to spending money on circuses when there ain\\'t no other way, but\\nthere ain\\'t no use in _wasting_ it on them.\\n\\nIt was a real bully circus. \\ufffdIt was the splendidest sight that ever was\\nwhen they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side\\nby side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes\\nnor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and\\ncomfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a\\nlovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang\\nof real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of\\ndollars, and just littered with diamonds. \\ufffdIt was a powerful fine sight;\\nI never see anything so lovely. \\ufffdAnd then one by one they got up\\nand stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and\\ngraceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\\nheads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and\\nevery lady\\'s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,\\nand she looking like the most loveliest parasol.\\n\\nAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one\\nfoot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and\\nmore, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking\\nhis whip and shouting \"Hi!--hi!\" and the clown cracking jokes behind\\nhim; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her\\nknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how\\nthe horses did lean over and hump themselves! \\ufffdAnd so one after the\\nother they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I\\never see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and\\nwent just about wild.\\n\\nWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and\\nall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. \\ufffdThe\\nringmaster couldn\\'t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick\\nas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\\n_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I\\ncouldn\\'t noway understand. Why, I couldn\\'t a thought of them in a year.\\nAnd by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to\\nride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. \\ufffdThey argued\\nand tried to keep him out, but he wouldn\\'t listen, and the whole show\\ncome to a standstill. \\ufffdThen the people begun to holler at him and make\\nfun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\\nstirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\\nbenches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down! throw him\\nout!\" and one or two women begun to scream. \\ufffdSo, then, the ringmaster\\nhe made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn\\'t be no\\ndisturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn\\'t make no more\\ntrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\\n\\ufffdSo everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\\nhe was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\\nwith two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\\ndrunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\\njump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\\ntill tears rolled down. \\ufffdAnd at last, sure enough, all the circus men\\ncould do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\\nround and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\\nto his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\\nand then t\\'other one on t\\'other side, and the people just crazy. \\ufffdIt\\nwarn\\'t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\\n\\ufffdBut pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\\na-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\\ndropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\\ntoo. \\ufffdHe just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\\nas if he warn\\'t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\\nclothes and sling them. \\ufffdHe shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\\nthe air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\\nwas, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\\never saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\\nhum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\\nthe dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\\nastonishment.\\n\\nThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\\nsickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. \\ufffdWhy, it was one of his own\\nmen! \\ufffdHe had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on\\nto nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn\\'t\\na been in that ringmaster\\'s place, not for a thousand dollars. \\ufffdI don\\'t\\nknow; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I\\nnever struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and\\nwherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.\\n\\nWell, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn\\'t only about twelve\\npeople there--just enough to pay expenses. \\ufffdAnd they laughed all the\\ntime, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before\\nthe show was over, but one boy which was asleep. \\ufffdSo the duke said these\\nArkansaw lunkheads couldn\\'t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted\\nwas low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he\\nreckoned. \\ufffdHe said he could size their style. \\ufffdSo next morning he got\\nsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off\\nsome handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. \\ufffdThe bills said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\nWELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and\\na curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house\\nwas jam full of men in no time. \\ufffdWhen the place couldn\\'t hold no more,\\nthe duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on\\nto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,\\nand praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one\\nthat ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about\\nEdmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;\\nand at last when he\\'d got everybody\\'s expectations up high enough, he\\nrolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing\\nout on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,\\nring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a\\nrainbow. \\ufffdAnd--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,\\nbut it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and\\nwhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they\\nroared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done\\nit over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it\\nwould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.\\n\\nThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says\\nthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of\\npressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it\\nin Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has\\nsucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply\\nobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come\\nand see it.\\n\\nTwenty people sings out:\\n\\n\"What, is it over? \\ufffdIs that _all_?\"\\n\\nThe duke says yes. \\ufffdThen there was a fine time. \\ufffdEverybody sings\\nout, \"Sold!\" and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them\\ntragedians. \\ufffdBut a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:\\n\\n\"Hold on! \\ufffdJust a word, gentlemen.\" \\ufffdThey stopped to listen. \\ufffd\"We are\\nsold--mighty badly sold. \\ufffdBut we don\\'t want to be the laughing stock of\\nthis whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long\\nas we live. \\ufffd_No_. \\ufffdWhat we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk\\nthis show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town! \\ufffdThen we\\'ll all be in the\\nsame boat. \\ufffdAin\\'t that sensible?\" (\"You bet it is!--the jedge is right!\"\\neverybody sings out.) \"All right, then--not a word about any sell. \\ufffdGo\\nalong home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.\"\\n\\nNext day you couldn\\'t hear nothing around that town but how splendid\\nthat show was. \\ufffdHouse was jammed again that night, and we sold this\\ncrowd the same way. \\ufffdWhen me and the king and the duke got home to the\\nraft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim\\nand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and\\nfetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.\\n\\nThe third night the house was crammed again--and they warn\\'t new-comers\\nthis time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. \\ufffdI\\nstood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had\\nhis pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it\\nwarn\\'t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. \\ufffdI smelt sickly eggs\\nby the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the\\nsigns of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four\\nof them went in. \\ufffdI shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various\\nfor me; I couldn\\'t stand it. \\ufffdWell, when the place couldn\\'t hold no more\\npeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door\\nfor him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after\\nhim; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:\\n\\n\"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the\\nraft like the dickens was after you!\"\\n\\nI done it, and he done the same. \\ufffdWe struck the raft at the same time,\\nand in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and\\nstill, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a\\nword. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the\\naudience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under\\nthe wigwam, and says:\\n\\n\"Well, how\\'d the old thing pan out this time, duke?\" \\ufffdHe hadn\\'t been\\nup-town at all.\\n\\nWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.\\nThen we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly\\nlaughed their bones loose over the way they\\'d served them people. \\ufffdThe\\nduke says:\\n\\n\"Greenhorns, flatheads! \\ufffdI knew the first house would keep mum and let\\nthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they\\'d lay for us the\\nthird night, and consider it was _their_ turn now. \\ufffdWell, it _is_ their\\nturn, and I\\'d give something to know how much they\\'d take for it. \\ufffdI\\n_would_ just like to know how they\\'re putting in their opportunity.\\n\\ufffdThey can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty\\nprovisions.\"\\n\\nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that\\nthree nights. \\ufffdI never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that\\nbefore. \\ufffdBy and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t it s\\'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I says, \"it don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t it, Huck?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it don\\'t, because it\\'s in the breed. \\ufffdI reckon they\\'re all\\nalike.\"\\n\\n\"But, Huck, dese kings o\\' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat\\'s jist what\\ndey is; dey\\'s reglar rapscallions.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s what I\\'m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as\\nfur as I can make out.\"\\n\\n\"Is dat so?\"\\n\\n\"You read about them once--you\\'ll see. \\ufffdLook at Henry the Eight; this \\'n\\n\\'s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_. \\ufffdAnd look at Charles Second,\\nand Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward\\nSecond, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon\\nheptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. \\ufffdMy,\\nyou ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. \\ufffdHe _was_ a\\nblossom. \\ufffdHe used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head\\nnext morning. \\ufffdAnd he would do it just as indifferent as if he was\\nordering up eggs. \\ufffd\\'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,\\' he says. \\ufffdThey fetch her up.\\nNext morning, \\'Chop off her head!\\' \\ufffdAnd they chop it off. \\ufffd\\'Fetch up\\nJane Shore,\\' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, \\'Chop off her\\nhead\\'--and they chop it off. \\ufffd\\'Ring up Fair Rosamun.\\' \\ufffdFair Rosamun\\nanswers the bell. \\ufffdNext morning, \\'Chop off her head.\\' \\ufffdAnd he made every\\none of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had\\nhogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a\\nbook, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the\\ncase. \\ufffdYou don\\'t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip\\nof ourn is one of the cleanest I\\'ve struck in history. \\ufffdWell, Henry he\\ntakes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How\\ndoes he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show? \\ufffdNo. \\ufffdAll of a\\nsudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks\\nout a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. \\ufffdThat was\\n_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance. \\ufffdHe had suspicions of his\\nfather, the Duke of Wellington. \\ufffdWell, what did he do? \\ufffdAsk him to show\\nup? \\ufffdNo--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. \\ufffdS\\'pose people\\nleft money laying around where he was--what did he do? \\ufffdHe collared it.\\n\\ufffdS\\'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn\\'t set\\ndown there and see that he done it--what did he do? \\ufffdHe always done the\\nother thing. S\\'pose he opened his mouth--what then? \\ufffdIf he didn\\'t shut it\\nup powerful quick he\\'d lose a lie every time. \\ufffdThat\\'s the kind of a bug\\nHenry was; and if we\\'d a had him along \\'stead of our kings he\\'d a fooled\\nthat town a heap worse than ourn done. \\ufffdI don\\'t say that ourn is lambs,\\nbecause they ain\\'t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they\\nain\\'t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway. \\ufffdAll I say is, kings is kings,\\nand you got to make allowances. \\ufffdTake them all around, they\\'re a mighty\\nornery lot. It\\'s the way they\\'re raised.\"\\n\\n\"But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.\"\\n\\n\"Well, they all do, Jim. \\ufffdWe can\\'t help the way a king smells; history\\ndon\\'t tell no way.\"\\n\\n\"Now de duke, he\\'s a tolerble likely man in some ways.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a duke\\'s different. \\ufffdBut not very different. \\ufffdThis one\\'s\\na middling hard lot for a duke. \\ufffdWhen he\\'s drunk there ain\\'t no\\nnear-sighted man could tell him from a king.\"\\n\\n\"Well, anyways, I doan\\' hanker for no mo\\' un um, Huck. \\ufffdDese is all I\\nkin stan\\'.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the way I feel, too, Jim. \\ufffdBut we\\'ve got them on our hands, and we\\ngot to remember what they are, and make allowances. \\ufffdSometimes I wish we\\ncould hear of a country that\\'s out of kings.\"\\n\\nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn\\'t real kings and dukes? \\ufffdIt\\nwouldn\\'t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: \\ufffdyou\\ncouldn\\'t tell them from the real kind.\\n\\nI went to sleep, and Jim didn\\'t call me when it was my turn. \\ufffdHe often\\ndone that. \\ufffdWhen I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with\\nhis head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. \\ufffdI\\ndidn\\'t take notice nor let on. \\ufffdI knowed what it was about. \\ufffdHe was\\nthinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low\\nand homesick; because he hadn\\'t ever been away from home before in his\\nlife; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white\\nfolks does for their\\'n. \\ufffdIt don\\'t seem natural, but I reckon it\\'s so.\\n\\ufffdHe was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I\\nwas asleep, and saying, \"Po\\' little \\'Lizabeth! po\\' little Johnny! it\\'s\\nmighty hard; I spec\\' I ain\\'t ever gwyne to see you no mo\\', no mo\\'!\" \\ufffdHe\\nwas a mighty good nigger, Jim was.\\n\\nBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young\\nones; and by and by he says:\\n\\n\"What makes me feel so bad dis time \\'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder\\non de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time\\nI treat my little \\'Lizabeth so ornery. \\ufffdShe warn\\'t on\\'y \\'bout fo\\' year\\nole, en she tuck de sk\\'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but\\nshe got well, en one day she was a-stannin\\' aroun\\', en I says to her, I\\nsays:\\n\\n\"\\'Shet de do\\'.\\'\\n\\n\"She never done it; jis\\' stood dah, kiner smilin\\' up at me. \\ufffdIt make me\\nmad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:\\n\\n\"\\'Doan\\' you hear me? \\ufffdShet de do\\'!\\'\\n\\n\"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin\\' up. \\ufffdI was a-bilin\\'! \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"\\'I lay I _make_ you mine!\\'\\n\\n\"En wid dat I fetch\\' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin\\'.\\nDen I went into de yuther room, en \\'uz gone \\'bout ten minutes; en when\\nI come back dah was dat do\\' a-stannin\\' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin\\'\\nmos\\' right in it, a-lookin\\' down and mournin\\', en de tears runnin\\' down.\\n\\ufffdMy, but I _wuz_ mad! \\ufffdI was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis\\' den--it was a\\ndo\\' dat open innerds--jis\\' den, \\'long come de wind en slam it to, behine\\nde chile, ker-BLAM!--en my lan\\', de chile never move\\'! \\ufffdMy breff mos\\'\\nhop outer me; en I feel so--so--I doan\\' know HOW I feel. \\ufffdI crope out,\\nall a-tremblin\\', en crope aroun\\' en open de do\\' easy en slow, en poke my\\nhead in behine de chile, sof\\' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW!\\njis\\' as loud as I could yell. \\ufffd_She never budge!_ \\ufffdOh, Huck, I bust out\\na-cryin\\' en grab her up in my arms, en say, \\'Oh, de po\\' little thing!\\n\\ufffdDe Lord God Amighty fogive po\\' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive\\nhisself as long\\'s he live!\\' \\ufffdOh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb\\ndeef en dumb--en I\\'d ben a-treat\\'n her so!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\nNEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in\\nthe middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\\nduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. \\ufffdJim\\nhe spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn\\'t take but a few\\nhours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\\nlay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. \\ufffdYou see, when we left him\\nall alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\\nby himself and not tied it wouldn\\'t look much like he was a runaway\\nnigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\\nroped all day, and he\\'d cipher out some way to get around it.\\n\\nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. \\ufffdHe dressed\\nJim up in King Lear\\'s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\\nwhite horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\\nand painted Jim\\'s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\\ndull, solid blue, like a man that\\'s been drownded nine days. \\ufffdBlamed if\\nhe warn\\'t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. \\ufffdThen the duke took\\nand wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\\n\\nSick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\\n\\nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\\nfoot in front of the wigwam. \\ufffdJim was satisfied. \\ufffdHe said it was a sight\\nbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\\nover every time there was a sound. \\ufffdThe duke told him to make himself\\nfree and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\\nout of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\\na wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\\n\\ufffdWhich was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\\nwouldn\\'t wait for him to howl. \\ufffdWhy, he didn\\'t only look like he was\\ndead, he looked considerable more than that.\\n\\nThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\\nso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn\\'t be safe, because maybe\\nthe news might a worked along down by this time. \\ufffdThey couldn\\'t hit no\\nproject that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he\\'d\\nlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn\\'t put up\\nsomething on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\\nover to t\\'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\\nto lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon. \\ufffdWe had all\\nbought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his\\'n\\non, and he told me to put mine on. \\ufffdI done it, of course. \\ufffdThe king\\'s\\nduds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. \\ufffdI never\\nknowed how clothes could change a body before. \\ufffdWhy, before, he looked\\nlike the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he\\'d take off\\nhis new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\\nand good and pious that you\\'d say he had walked right out of the ark,\\nand maybe was old Leviticus himself. \\ufffdJim cleaned up the canoe, and I\\ngot my paddle ready. \\ufffdThere was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\\nup under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\\nof hours, taking on freight. \\ufffdSays the king:\\n\\n\"Seein\\' how I\\'m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.\\nLouis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. \\ufffdGo for the steamboat,\\nHuckleberry; we\\'ll come down to the village on her.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.\\n\\ufffdI fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\\nscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. \\ufffdPretty soon we come to\\na nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\\nsweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\\ncouple of big carpet-bags by him.\\n\\n\"Run her nose in shore,\" says the king. \\ufffdI done it. \\ufffd\"Wher\\' you bound\\nfor, young man?\"\\n\\n\"For the steamboat; going to Orleans.\"\\n\\n\"Git aboard,\" says the king. \\ufffd\"Hold on a minute, my servant \\'ll he\\'p you\\nwith them bags. \\ufffdJump out and he\\'p the gentleman, Adolphus\"--meaning me,\\nI see.\\n\\nI done so, and then we all three started on again. \\ufffdThe young chap was\\nmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.\\nHe asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he\\'d come\\ndown the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\\nwas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. \\ufffdThe\\nyoung fellow says:\\n\\n\"When I first see you I says to myself, \\'It\\'s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\\ncome mighty near getting here in time.\\' \\ufffdBut then I says again, \\'No, I\\nreckon it ain\\'t him, or else he wouldn\\'t be paddling up the river.\\' \\ufffdYou\\n_ain\\'t_ him, are you?\"\\n\\n\"No, my name\\'s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander\\nBlodgett, I s\\'pose I must say, as I\\'m one o\\' the Lord\\'s poor servants.\\n\\ufffdBut still I\\'m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving\\nin time, all the same, if he\\'s missed anything by it--which I hope he\\nhasn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he don\\'t miss any property by it, because he\\'ll get that all\\nright; but he\\'s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn\\'t\\nmind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything\\nin this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing\\nelse all these three weeks; hadn\\'t seen him since they was boys\\ntogether--and hadn\\'t ever seen his brother William at all--that\\'s the deef\\nand dumb one--William ain\\'t more than thirty or thirty-five. \\ufffdPeter and\\nGeorge were the only ones that come out here; George was the married\\nbrother; him and his wife both died last year. \\ufffdHarvey and William\\'s the\\nonly ones that\\'s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven\\'t got here\\nin time.\"\\n\\n\"Did anybody send \\'em word?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter\\nsaid then that he sorter felt like he warn\\'t going to get well this\\ntime. You see, he was pretty old, and George\\'s g\\'yirls was too young to\\nbe much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he\\nwas kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn\\'t seem\\nto care much to live. \\ufffdHe most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and\\nWilliam, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can\\'t\\nbear to make a will. \\ufffdHe left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he\\'d\\ntold in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the\\nproperty divided up so George\\'s g\\'yirls would be all right--for George\\ndidn\\'t leave nothing. \\ufffdAnd that letter was all they could get him to put\\na pen to.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you reckon Harvey don\\'t come? \\ufffdWher\\' does he live?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn\\'t ever been in\\nthis country. \\ufffdHe hasn\\'t had any too much time--and besides he mightn\\'t a\\ngot the letter at all, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Too bad, too bad he couldn\\'t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.\\nYou going to Orleans, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but that ain\\'t only a part of it. \\ufffdI\\'m going in a ship, next\\nWednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pretty long journey. \\ufffdBut it\\'ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.\\nIs Mary Jane the oldest? \\ufffdHow old is the others?\"\\n\\n\"Mary Jane\\'s nineteen, Susan\\'s fifteen, and Joanna\\'s about\\nfourteen--that\\'s the one that gives herself to good works and has a\\nhare-lip.\"\\n\\n\"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.\"\\n\\n\"Well, they could be worse off. \\ufffdOld Peter had friends, and they\\nain\\'t going to let them come to no harm. \\ufffdThere\\'s Hobson, the Babtis\\'\\npreacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,\\nand Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the\\nwidow Bartley, and--well, there\\'s a lot of them; but these are the ones\\nthat Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when\\nhe wrote home; so Harvey \\'ll know where to look for friends when he gets\\nhere.\"\\n\\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied\\nthat young fellow. \\ufffdBlamed if he didn\\'t inquire about everybody and\\neverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about\\nPeter\\'s business--which was a tanner; and about George\\'s--which was a\\ncarpenter; and about Harvey\\'s--which was a dissentering minister; and so\\non, and so on. \\ufffdThen he says:\\n\\n\"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\"\\n\\n\"Because she\\'s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn\\'t stop\\nthere. \\ufffdWhen they\\'re deep they won\\'t stop for a hail. \\ufffdA Cincinnati boat\\nwill, but this is a St. Louis one.\"\\n\\n\"Was Peter Wilks well off?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, pretty well off. \\ufffdHe had houses and land, and it\\'s reckoned he\\nleft three or four thousand in cash hid up som\\'ers.\"\\n\\n\"When did you say he died?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t say, but it was last night.\"\\n\\n\"Funeral to-morrow, likely?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, \\'bout the middle of the day.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s all terrible sad; but we\\'ve all got to go, one time or\\nanother. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we\\'re all right.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, it\\'s the best way. \\ufffdMa used to always say that.\"\\n\\nWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she\\ngot off. \\ufffdThe king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\\nmy ride, after all. \\ufffdWhen the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\\nanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\\n\\n\"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\\ncarpet-bags. \\ufffdAnd if he\\'s gone over to t\\'other side, go over there and\\ngit him. \\ufffdAnd tell him to git himself up regardless. \\ufffdShove along, now.\"\\n\\nI see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. \\ufffdWhen\\nI got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\\nlog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\\nsaid it--every last word of it. \\ufffdAnd all the time he was a-doing it he\\ntried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\\na slouch. I can\\'t imitate him, and so I ain\\'t a-going to try to; but he\\nreally done it pretty good. \\ufffdThen he says:\\n\\n\"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\"\\n\\nThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef\\nand dumb person on the histronic boards. \\ufffdSo then they waited for a\\nsteamboat.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\\nbut they didn\\'t come from high enough up the river; but at last there\\nwas a big one, and they hailed her. \\ufffdShe sent out her yawl, and we went\\naboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted\\nto go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and\\nsaid they wouldn\\'t land us. \\ufffdBut the king was ca\\'m. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and\\nput off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry \\'em, can\\'t it?\"\\n\\nSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\\nvillage they yawled us ashore. \\ufffdAbout two dozen men flocked down when\\nthey see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\\n\\n\"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher\\' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\" they\\ngive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,\\n\"What d\\' I tell you?\" \\ufffdThen one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\\nlive yesterday evening.\"\\n\\nSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up\\nagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\\nback, and says:\\n\\n\"Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,\\nit\\'s too, too hard!\"\\n\\nThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\\nthe duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn\\'t drop a carpet-bag and\\nbust out a-crying. \\ufffdIf they warn\\'t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,\\nthat ever I struck.\\n\\nWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\\nsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill\\nfor them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about\\nhis brother\\'s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on\\nhis hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner\\nlike they\\'d lost the twelve disciples. \\ufffdWell, if ever I struck anything\\nlike it, I\\'m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human\\nrace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\nTHE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people\\ntearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on\\ntheir coats as they come. \\ufffdPretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,\\nand the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. \\ufffdThe windows and\\ndooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:\\n\\n\"Is it _them_?\"\\n\\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\\n\\n\"You bet it is.\"\\n\\nWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\\nthree girls was standing in the door. \\ufffdMary Jane _was_ red-headed, but\\nthat don\\'t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her\\nface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles\\nwas come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for\\nthem, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!\\n\\ufffdEverybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again\\nat last and have such good times.\\n\\nThen the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he\\nlooked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so\\nthen him and the duke, with a hand across each other\\'s shoulder, and\\nt\\'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody\\ndropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,\\npeople saying \"Sh!\" and all the men taking their hats off and drooping\\ntheir heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. \\ufffdAnd when they got there\\nthey bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then\\nthey bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and\\nthen they put their arms around each other\\'s necks, and hung their chins\\nover each other\\'s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,\\nI never see two men leak the way they done. \\ufffdAnd, mind you, everybody\\nwas doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything\\nlike it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t\\'other on\\nt\\'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the\\ncoffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. \\ufffdWell, when it come\\nto that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and\\neverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,\\ntoo; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a\\nword, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand\\non their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running\\ndown, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give\\nthe next woman a show. \\ufffdI never see anything so disgusting.\\n\\nWell, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and\\nworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and\\nflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother\\nto lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long\\njourney of four thousand mile, but it\\'s a trial that\\'s sweetened and\\nsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he\\nthanks them out of his heart and out of his brother\\'s heart, because out\\nof their mouths they can\\'t, words being too weak and cold, and all that\\nkind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers\\nout a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying\\nfit to bust.\\n\\nAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the\\ncrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their\\nmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church\\nletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and\\nhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and\\nbully.\\n\\nThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\\nnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the\\nfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up\\nwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying\\nyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that\\nwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will\\nname the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon\\nLot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and\\nDr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.\\n\\nRev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\\ntogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t\\'other\\nworld, and the preacher was pinting him right. \\ufffdLawyer Bell was away up\\nto Louisville on business. \\ufffdBut the rest was on hand, and so they all\\ncome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;\\nand then they shook hands with the duke and didn\\'t say nothing, but just\\nkept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst\\nhe made all sorts of signs with his hands and said \"Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo\"\\nall the time, like a baby that can\\'t talk.\\n\\nSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty\\nmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts\\nof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to\\nGeorge\\'s family, or to Peter. \\ufffdAnd he always let on that Peter wrote him\\nthe things; but that was a lie: \\ufffdhe got every blessed one of them out of\\nthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.\\n\\nThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the\\nking he read it out loud and cried over it. \\ufffdIt give the dwelling-house\\nand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard\\n(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and\\nland (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold\\nto Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down\\ncellar. \\ufffdSo these two frauds said they\\'d go and fetch it up, and have\\neverything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.\\n\\ufffdWe shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag\\nthey spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them\\nyaller-boys. \\ufffdMy, the way the king\\'s eyes did shine! \\ufffdHe slaps the duke\\non the shoulder and says:\\n\\n\"Oh, _this_ ain\\'t bully nor noth\\'n! \\ufffdOh, no, I reckon not! \\ufffdWhy,\\n_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don\\'t_ it?\"\\n\\nThe duke allowed it did. \\ufffdThey pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them\\nthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the\\nking says:\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t no use talkin\\'; bein\\' brothers to a rich dead man and\\nrepresentatives of furrin heirs that\\'s got left is the line for you and\\nme, Bilge. \\ufffdThish yer comes of trust\\'n to Providence. \\ufffdIt\\'s the best\\nway, in the long run. \\ufffdI\\'ve tried \\'em all, and ther\\' ain\\'t no better\\nway.\"\\n\\nMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on\\ntrust; but no, they must count it. \\ufffdSo they counts it, and it comes out\\nfour hundred and fifteen dollars short. \\ufffdSays the king:\\n\\n\"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen\\ndollars?\"\\n\\nThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. \\ufffdThen\\nthe duke says:\\n\\n\"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon\\nthat\\'s the way of it. \\ufffdThe best way\\'s to let it go, and keep still about\\nit. \\ufffdWe can spare it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it. \\ufffdI don\\'t k\\'yer noth\\'n \\'bout\\nthat--it\\'s the _count_ I\\'m thinkin\\' about. \\ufffdWe want to be awful square\\nand open and above-board here, you know. \\ufffdWe want to lug this h-yer\\nmoney up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther\\' ain\\'t noth\\'n\\nsuspicious. \\ufffdBut when the dead man says ther\\'s six thous\\'n dollars, you\\nknow, we don\\'t want to--\"\\n\\n\"Hold on,\" says the duke. \\ufffd\"Le\\'s make up the deffisit,\" and he begun to\\nhaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a most amaz\\'n\\' good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin\\' clever\\nhead on you,\" says the king. \\ufffd\"Blest if the old Nonesuch ain\\'t a heppin\\'\\nus out agin,\" and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them\\nup.\\n\\nIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.\\n\\n\"Say,\" says the duke, \"I got another idea. \\ufffdLe\\'s go up stairs and count\\nthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.\"\\n\\n\"Good land, duke, lemme hug you! \\ufffdIt\\'s the most dazzling idea \\'at ever a\\nman struck. \\ufffdYou have cert\\'nly got the most astonishin\\' head I ever see.\\nOh, this is the boss dodge, ther\\' ain\\'t no mistake \\'bout it. \\ufffdLet \\'em\\nfetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this \\'ll lay \\'em out.\"\\n\\nWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king\\nhe counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty\\nelegant little piles. \\ufffdEverybody looked hungry at it, and licked their\\nchops. \\ufffdThen they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin\\nto swell himself up for another speech. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by\\nthem that\\'s left behind in the vale of sorrers. \\ufffdHe has done generous by\\nthese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that\\'s left\\nfatherless and motherless. \\ufffdYes, and we that knowed him knows that he\\nwould a done _more_ generous by \\'em if he hadn\\'t ben afeard o\\' woundin\\'\\nhis dear William and me. \\ufffdNow, _wouldn\\'t_ he? \\ufffdTher\\' ain\\'t no question\\n\\'bout it in _my_ mind. \\ufffdWell, then, what kind o\\' brothers would it be\\nthat \\'d stand in his way at sech a time? \\ufffdAnd what kind o\\' uncles would\\nit be that \\'d rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these \\'at he loved\\nso at sech a time? \\ufffdIf I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I\\'ll\\njest ask him.\" He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to\\nthe duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and\\nleather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his\\nmeaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,\\nand hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. \\ufffdThen the king says,\\n\"I knowed it; I reckon _that \\'ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels\\nabout it. \\ufffdHere, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it\\n_all_. \\ufffdIt\\'s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.\"\\n\\nMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the\\nduke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. \\ufffdAnd\\neverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the\\nhands off of them frauds, saying all the time:\\n\\n\"You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!\"\\n\\nWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased\\nagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and\\nbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,\\nand stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody\\nsaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was\\nall busy listening. \\ufffdThe king was saying--in the middle of something he\\'d\\nstarted in on--\\n\\n\"--they bein\\' partickler friends o\\' the diseased. \\ufffdThat\\'s why they\\'re\\ninvited here this evenin\\'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;\\nfor he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it\\'s fitten that\\nhis funeral orgies sh\\'d be public.\"\\n\\nAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and\\nevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke\\nhe couldn\\'t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,\\n\"_Obsequies_, you old fool,\" and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and\\nreaching it over people\\'s heads to him. \\ufffdThe king he reads it and puts\\nit in his pocket, and says:\\n\\n\"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart\\'s_ aluz right. \\ufffdAsks me\\nto invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make \\'em all\\nwelcome. \\ufffdBut he needn\\'t a worried--it was jest what I was at.\"\\n\\nThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca\\'m, and goes to dropping in his\\nfuneral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. \\ufffdAnd\\nwhen he done it the third time he says:\\n\\n\"I say orgies, not because it\\'s the common term, because it\\nain\\'t--obsequies bein\\' the common term--but because orgies is the right\\nterm. Obsequies ain\\'t used in England no more now--it\\'s gone out. \\ufffdWe\\nsay orgies now in England. \\ufffdOrgies is better, because it means the thing\\nyou\\'re after more exact. \\ufffdIt\\'s a word that\\'s made up out\\'n the Greek\\n_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover\\nup; hence in_ter._ \\ufffdSo, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public\\nfuneral.\"\\n\\nHe was the _worst_ I ever struck. \\ufffdWell, the iron-jawed man he laughed\\nright in his face. \\ufffdEverybody was shocked. \\ufffdEverybody says, \"Why,\\n_doctor_!\" and Abner Shackleford says:\\n\\n\"Why, Robinson, hain\\'t you heard the news? \\ufffdThis is Harvey Wilks.\"\\n\\nThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:\\n\\n\"Is it my poor brother\\'s dear good friend and physician? \\ufffdI--\"\\n\\n\"Keep your hands off of me!\" says the doctor. \\ufffd\"_You_ talk like an\\nEnglishman, _don\\'t_ you? \\ufffdIt\\'s the worst imitation I ever heard. \\ufffd_You_\\nPeter Wilks\\'s brother! \\ufffdYou\\'re a fraud, that\\'s what you are!\"\\n\\nWell, how they all took on! \\ufffdThey crowded around the doctor and tried to\\nquiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey \\'d\\nshowed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,\\nand the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt\\nHarvey\\'s feelings and the poor girl\\'s feelings, and all that. \\ufffdBut it\\nwarn\\'t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended\\nto be an Englishman and couldn\\'t imitate the lingo no better than what\\nhe did was a fraud and a liar. \\ufffdThe poor girls was hanging to the king\\nand crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_. \\ufffdHe\\nsays:\\n\\n\"I was your father\\'s friend, and I\\'m your friend; and I warn you as a\\nfriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of\\nharm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing\\nto do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,\\nas he calls it. \\ufffdHe is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here\\nwith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and\\nyou take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these\\nfoolish friends here, who ought to know better. \\ufffdMary Jane Wilks, you\\nknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. \\ufffdNow listen\\nto me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it. \\ufffdWill you?\"\\n\\nMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! \\ufffdShe\\nsays:\\n\\n\"_Here_ is my answer.\" \\ufffdShe hove up the bag of money and put it in the\\nking\\'s hands, and says, \"Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for\\nme and my sisters any way you want to, and don\\'t give us no receipt for\\nit.\"\\n\\nThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the\\nhare-lip done the same on the other. \\ufffdEverybody clapped their hands and\\nstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his\\nhead and smiled proud. \\ufffdThe doctor says:\\n\\n\"All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter. \\ufffdBut I warn you all that a\\ntime \\'s coming when you\\'re going to feel sick whenever you think of this\\nday.\" And away he went.\\n\\n\"All right, doctor,\" says the king, kinder mocking him; \"we\\'ll try and\\nget \\'em to send for you;\" which made them all laugh, and they said it\\nwas a prime good hit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\nWELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off\\nfor spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for\\nUncle William, and she\\'d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was\\na little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and\\nsleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.\\nThe king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.\\n\\nSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was\\nplain but nice. \\ufffdShe said she\\'d have her frocks and a lot of other traps\\ntook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey\\'s way, but he said\\nthey warn\\'t. \\ufffdThe frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was\\na curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. \\ufffdThere was an\\nold hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts\\nof little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room\\nwith. \\ufffdThe king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for\\nthese fixings, and so don\\'t disturb them. \\ufffdThe duke\\'s room was pretty\\nsmall, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.\\n\\nThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,\\nand I stood behind the king and the duke\\'s chairs and waited on them,\\nand the niggers waited on the rest. \\ufffdMary Jane she set at the head of\\nthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits\\nwas, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried\\nchickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to\\nforce out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,\\nand said so--said \"How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?\" and\\n\"Where, for the land\\'s sake, _did_ you get these amaz\\'n pickles?\" and\\nall that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a\\nsupper, you know.\\n\\nAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen\\noff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up\\nthe things. \\ufffdThe hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest\\nif I didn\\'t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. \\ufffdShe says:\\n\\n\"Did you ever see the king?\"\\n\\n\"Who? \\ufffdWilliam Fourth? \\ufffdWell, I bet I have--he goes to our church.\" \\ufffdI\\nknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. \\ufffdSo when I says he\\ngoes to our church, she says:\\n\\n\"What--regular?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--regular. \\ufffdHis pew\\'s right over opposite ourn--on t\\'other side the\\npulpit.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he lived in London?\"\\n\\n\"Well, he does. \\ufffdWhere _would_ he live?\"\\n\\n\"But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?\"\\n\\nI see I was up a stump. \\ufffdI had to let on to get choked with a chicken\\nbone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. \\ufffdThen I says:\\n\\n\"I mean he goes to our church regular when he\\'s in Sheffield. \\ufffdThat\\'s\\nonly in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.\"\\n\\n\"Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain\\'t on the sea.\"\\n\\n\"Well, who said it was?\"\\n\\n\"Why, you did.\"\\n\\n\"I _didn\\'t_ nuther.\"\\n\\n\"You did!\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"You did.\"\\n\\n\"I never said nothing of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what _did_ you say, then?\"\\n\\n\"Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that\\'s what I said.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, how\\'s he going to take the sea baths if it ain\\'t on the\\nsea?\"\\n\\n\"Looky here,\" I says; \"did you ever see any Congress-water?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no.\"\\n\\n\"Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea\\nbath.\"\\n\\n\"How does he get it, then?\"\\n\\n\"Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels. \\ufffdThere\\nin the palace at Sheffield they\\'ve got furnaces, and he wants his water\\nhot. \\ufffdThey can\\'t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.\\nThey haven\\'t got no conveniences for it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see, now. \\ufffdYou might a said that in the first place and saved\\ntime.\"\\n\\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was\\ncomfortable and glad. \\ufffdNext, she says:\\n\\n\"Do you go to church, too?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--regular.\"\\n\\n\"Where do you set?\"\\n\\n\"Why, in our pew.\"\\n\\n\"_Whose_ pew?\"\\n\\n\"Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"His\\'n? \\ufffdWhat does _he_ want with a pew?\"\\n\\n\"Wants it to set in. \\ufffdWhat did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I thought he\\'d be in the pulpit.\"\\n\\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. \\ufffdI see I was up a stump again, so I\\nplayed another chicken bone and got another think. \\ufffdThen I says:\\n\\n\"Blame it, do you suppose there ain\\'t but one preacher to a church?\"\\n\\n\"Why, what do they want with more?\"\\n\\n\"What!--to preach before a king? \\ufffdI never did see such a girl as you.\\nThey don\\'t have no less than seventeen.\"\\n\\n\"Seventeen! \\ufffdMy land! \\ufffdWhy, I wouldn\\'t set out such a string as that,\\nnot if I _never_ got to glory. \\ufffdIt must take \\'em a week.\"\\n\\n\"Shucks, they don\\'t _all_ of \\'em preach the same day--only _one_ of \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what does the rest of \\'em do?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, nothing much. \\ufffdLoll around, pass the plate--and one thing or\\nanother. \\ufffdBut mainly they don\\'t do nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what are they _for_?\"\\n\\n\"Why, they\\'re for _style_. \\ufffdDon\\'t you know nothing?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that. \\ufffdHow is\\nservants treated in England? \\ufffdDo they treat \\'em better \\'n we treat our\\nniggers?\"\\n\\n\"_No_! \\ufffdA servant ain\\'t nobody there. \\ufffdThey treat them worse than dogs.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t they give \\'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year\\'s\\nweek, and Fourth of July?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, just listen! \\ufffdA body could tell _you_ hain\\'t ever been to England\\nby that. \\ufffdWhy, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year\\'s\\nend to year\\'s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger\\nshows, nor nowheres.\"\\n\\n\"Nor church?\"\\n\\n\"Nor church.\"\\n\\n\"But _you_ always went to church.\"\\n\\nWell, I was gone up again. \\ufffdI forgot I was the old man\\'s servant. \\ufffdBut\\nnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was\\ndifferent from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he\\nwanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the\\nlaw. \\ufffdBut I didn\\'t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she\\nwarn\\'t satisfied. \\ufffdShe says:\\n\\n\"Honest injun, now, hain\\'t you been telling me a lot of lies?\"\\n\\n\"Honest injun,\" says I.\\n\\n\"None of it at all?\"\\n\\n\"None of it at all. \\ufffdNot a lie in it,\" says I.\\n\\n\"Lay your hand on this book and say it.\"\\n\\nI see it warn\\'t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and\\nsaid it. \\ufffdSo then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:\\n\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I\\'ll\\nbelieve the rest.\"\\n\\n\"What is it you won\\'t believe, Joe?\" says Mary Jane, stepping in with\\nSusan behind her. \\ufffd\"It ain\\'t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,\\nand him a stranger and so far from his people. \\ufffdHow would you like to be\\ntreated so?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before\\nthey\\'re hurt. \\ufffdI hain\\'t done nothing to him. \\ufffdHe\\'s told some stretchers,\\nI reckon, and I said I wouldn\\'t swallow it all; and that\\'s every bit\\nand grain I _did_ say. \\ufffdI reckon he can stand a little thing like that,\\ncan\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care whether \\'twas little or whether \\'twas big; he\\'s here in\\nour house and a stranger, and it wasn\\'t good of you to say it. \\ufffdIf you\\nwas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn\\'t to\\nsay a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mam, he said--\"\\n\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference what he _said_--that ain\\'t the thing. \\ufffdThe\\nthing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make\\nhim remember he ain\\'t in his own country and amongst his own folks.\"\\n\\nI says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I\\'m letting that old reptile rob\\nher of her money!\\n\\nThen Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you\\'ll believe me, she did give\\nHare-lip hark from the tomb!\\n\\nSays I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I\\'m letting him rob her\\nof her money!\\n\\nThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely\\nagain--which was her way; but when she got done there warn\\'t hardly\\nanything left o\\' poor Hare-lip. \\ufffdSo she hollered.\\n\\n\"All right, then,\" says the other girls; \"you just ask his pardon.\"\\n\\nShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful. \\ufffdShe done it so beautiful\\nit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so\\nshe could do it again.\\n\\nI says to myself, this is _another_ one that I\\'m letting him rob her of\\nher money. \\ufffdAnd when she got through they all jest laid theirselves\\nout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. \\ufffdI felt so\\nornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind\\'s made up;\\nI\\'ll hive that money for them or bust.\\n\\nSo then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. \\ufffdWhen\\nI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. \\ufffdI says to myself,\\nshall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? \\ufffdNo--that\\nwon\\'t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\\nmake it warm for me. \\ufffdShall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? \\ufffdNo--I\\ndasn\\'t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they\\'ve got the\\nmoney, and they\\'d slide right out and get away with it. \\ufffdIf she was to\\nfetch in help I\\'d get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\\nI judge. \\ufffdNo; there ain\\'t no good way but one. \\ufffdI got to steal that\\nmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won\\'t suspicion\\nthat I done it. They\\'ve got a good thing here, and they ain\\'t a-going\\nto leave till they\\'ve played this family and this town for all they\\'re\\nworth, so I\\'ll find a chance time enough. I\\'ll steal it and hide it; and\\nby and by, when I\\'m away down the river, I\\'ll write a letter and tell\\nMary Jane where it\\'s hid. \\ufffdBut I better hive it tonight if I can,\\nbecause the doctor maybe hasn\\'t let up as much as he lets on he has; he\\nmight scare them out of here yet.\\n\\nSo, thinks I, I\\'ll go and search them rooms. \\ufffdUpstairs the hall was\\ndark, but I found the duke\\'s room, and started to paw around it with\\nmy hands; but I recollected it wouldn\\'t be much like the king to let\\nanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\\nhis room and begun to paw around there. \\ufffdBut I see I couldn\\'t do nothing\\nwithout a candle, and I dasn\\'t light one, of course. \\ufffdSo I judged I\\'d\\ngot to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. \\ufffdAbout that time\\nI hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\\nreached for it, but it wasn\\'t where I thought it would be; but I touched\\nthe curtain that hid Mary Jane\\'s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\\nsnuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\\n\\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\\nget down and look under the bed. \\ufffdThen I was glad I hadn\\'t found the bed\\nwhen I wanted it. \\ufffdAnd yet, you know, it\\'s kind of natural to hide under\\nthe bed when you are up to anything private. \\ufffdThey sets down then, and\\nthe king says:\\n\\n\"Well, what is it? \\ufffdAnd cut it middlin\\' short, because it\\'s better for\\nus to be down there a-whoopin\\' up the mournin\\' than up here givin\\' \\'em a\\nchance to talk us over.\"\\n\\n\"Well, this is it, Capet. \\ufffdI ain\\'t easy; I ain\\'t comfortable. \\ufffdThat\\ndoctor lays on my mind. \\ufffdI wanted to know your plans. \\ufffdI\\'ve got a\\nnotion, and I think it\\'s a sound one.\"\\n\\n\"What is it, duke?\"\\n\\n\"That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip\\nit down the river with what we\\'ve got. \\ufffdSpecially, seeing we got it so\\neasy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of\\ncourse we allowed to have to steal it back. \\ufffdI\\'m for knocking off and\\nlighting out.\"\\n\\nThat made me feel pretty bad. \\ufffdAbout an hour or two ago it would a been\\na little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The\\nking rips out and says:\\n\\n\"What! \\ufffdAnd not sell out the rest o\\' the property? \\ufffdMarch off like\\na passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous\\'n\\' dollars\\' worth o\\'\\nproperty layin\\' around jest sufferin\\' to be scooped in?--and all good,\\nsalable stuff, too.\"\\n\\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn\\'t\\nwant to go no deeper--didn\\'t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_\\nthey had.\\n\\n\"Why, how you talk!\" says the king. \\ufffd\"We sha\\'n\\'t rob \\'em of nothing at\\nall but jest this money. \\ufffdThe people that _buys_ the property is the\\nsuff\\'rers; because as soon \\'s it\\'s found out \\'at we didn\\'t own it--which\\nwon\\'t be long after we\\'ve slid--the sale won\\'t be valid, and it \\'ll all\\ngo back to the estate. \\ufffdThese yer orphans \\'ll git their house back agin,\\nand that\\'s enough for _them_; they\\'re young and spry, and k\\'n easy\\nearn a livin\\'. \\ufffd_they_ ain\\'t a-goin to suffer. \\ufffdWhy, jest think--there\\'s\\nthous\\'n\\'s and thous\\'n\\'s that ain\\'t nigh so well off. \\ufffdBless you, _they_\\nain\\'t got noth\\'n\\' to complain of.\"\\n\\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all\\nright, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that\\ndoctor hanging over them. \\ufffdBut the king says:\\n\\n\"Cuss the doctor! \\ufffdWhat do we k\\'yer for _him_? \\ufffdHain\\'t we got all the\\nfools in town on our side? \\ufffdAnd ain\\'t that a big enough majority in any\\ntown?\"\\n\\nSo they got ready to go down stairs again. \\ufffdThe duke says:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we put that money in a good place.\"\\n\\nThat cheered me up. \\ufffdI\\'d begun to think I warn\\'t going to get a hint of\\nno kind to help me. \\ufffdThe king says:\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because Mary Jane \\'ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know\\nthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds\\nup and put \\'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and\\nnot borrow some of it?\"\\n\\n\"Your head\\'s level agin, duke,\" says the king; and he comes a-fumbling\\nunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was. \\ufffdI stuck tight to\\nthe wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them\\nfellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what\\nI\\'d better do if they did catch me. \\ufffdBut the king he got the bag before\\nI could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned\\nI was around. \\ufffdThey took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw\\ntick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two\\namongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only\\nmakes up the feather-bed, and don\\'t turn over the straw tick only about\\ntwice a year, and so it warn\\'t in no danger of getting stole now.\\n\\nBut I knowed better. \\ufffdI had it out of there before they was half-way\\ndown stairs. \\ufffdI groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I\\ncould get a chance to do better. \\ufffdI judged I better hide it outside\\nof the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the\\nhouse a good ransacking: \\ufffdI knowed that very well. \\ufffdThen I turned in,\\nwith my clothes all on; but I couldn\\'t a gone to sleep if I\\'d a wanted\\nto, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. \\ufffdBy and by I\\nheard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid\\nwith my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was\\ngoing to happen. \\ufffdBut nothing did.\\n\\nSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn\\'t\\nbegun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\nI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. \\ufffdSo I tiptoed\\nalong, and got down stairs all right. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t a sound anywheres.\\n\\ufffdI peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that\\nwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. \\ufffdThe door\\nwas open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a\\ncandle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but\\nI see there warn\\'t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I\\nshoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn\\'t there.\\n\\ufffdJust then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. \\ufffdI\\nrun in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I\\nsee to hide the bag was in the coffin. \\ufffdThe lid was shoved along about\\na foot, showing the dead man\\'s face down in there, with a wet cloth over\\nit, and his shroud on. \\ufffdI tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just\\ndown beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was\\nso cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.\\n\\nThe person coming was Mary Jane. \\ufffdShe went to the coffin, very soft, and\\nkneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see\\nshe begun to cry, though I couldn\\'t hear her, and her back was to me. \\ufffdI\\nslid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I\\'d make sure them\\nwatchers hadn\\'t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything\\nwas all right. \\ufffdThey hadn\\'t stirred.\\n\\nI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing\\nplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much\\nresk about it. \\ufffdSays I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because\\nwhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to\\nMary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain\\'t the\\nthing that\\'s going to happen; the thing that\\'s going to happen is, the\\nmoney \\'ll be found when they come to screw on the lid. \\ufffdThen the king\\n\\'ll get it again, and it \\'ll be a long day before he gives anybody\\nanother chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide\\ndown and get it out of there, but I dasn\\'t try it. \\ufffdEvery minute it was\\ngetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin\\nto stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my\\nhands that nobody hadn\\'t hired me to take care of. \\ufffdI don\\'t wish to be\\nmixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.\\n\\nWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the\\nwatchers was gone. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t nobody around but the family and the\\nwidow Bartley and our tribe. \\ufffdI watched their faces to see if anything\\nhad been happening, but I couldn\\'t tell.\\n\\nTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they\\nset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then\\nset all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till\\nthe hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. \\ufffdI see the coffin\\nlid was the way it was before, but I dasn\\'t go to look in under it, with\\nfolks around.\\n\\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took\\nseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour\\nthe people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the\\ndead man\\'s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was\\nall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding\\nhandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a\\nlittle. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on\\nthe floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a\\nfuneral than they do at other places except church.\\n\\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his\\nblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last\\ntouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,\\nand making no more sound than a cat. \\ufffdHe never spoke; he moved people\\naround, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\\nit with nods, and signs with his hands. \\ufffdThen he took his place over\\nagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever\\nsee; and there warn\\'t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\\n\\nThey had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready\\na young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and\\ncolicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one\\nthat had a good thing, according to my notion. \\ufffdThen the Reverend Hobson\\nopened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most\\noutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only\\none dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right\\nalong; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you\\ncouldn\\'t hear yourself think. \\ufffdIt was right down awkward, and nobody\\ndidn\\'t seem to know what to do. \\ufffdBut pretty soon they see that\\nlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,\\n\"Don\\'t you worry--just depend on me.\" \\ufffdThen he stooped down and begun\\nto glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\\'s\\nheads. \\ufffdSo he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and\\nmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\\nsides of the room, he disappears down cellar. \\ufffdThen in about two seconds\\nwe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or\\ntwo, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn\\ntalk where he left off. \\ufffdIn a minute or two here comes this undertaker\\'s\\nback and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and\\nglided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his\\nmouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,\\nover the people\\'s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"_He\\nhad a rat_!\" \\ufffdThen he drooped down and glided along the wall again to\\nhis place. \\ufffdYou could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,\\nbecause naturally they wanted to know. \\ufffdA little thing like that don\\'t\\ncost nothing, and it\\'s just the little things that makes a man to be\\nlooked up to and liked. \\ufffdThere warn\\'t no more popular man in town than\\nwhat that undertaker was.\\n\\nWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and\\nthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and\\nat last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the\\ncoffin with his screw-driver. \\ufffdI was in a sweat then, and watched him\\npretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as\\nsoft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. \\ufffdSo there I was! \\ufffdI\\ndidn\\'t know whether the money was in there or not. \\ufffdSo, says I, s\\'pose\\nsomebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether\\nto write to Mary Jane or not? S\\'pose she dug him up and didn\\'t find\\nnothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get\\nhunted up and jailed; I\\'d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at\\nall; the thing\\'s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I\\'ve worsened it\\na hundred times, and I wish to goodness I\\'d just let it alone, dad fetch\\nthe whole business!\\n\\nThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces\\nagain--I couldn\\'t help it, and I couldn\\'t rest easy. \\ufffdBut nothing come of\\nit; the faces didn\\'t tell me nothing.\\n\\nThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,\\nand made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his\\ncongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must\\nhurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. \\ufffdHe was\\nvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could\\nstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn\\'t be done. \\ufffdAnd he\\nsaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and\\nthat pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed\\nand amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled\\nthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told\\nhim to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. \\ufffdThem\\npoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them\\ngetting fooled and lied to so, but I didn\\'t see no safe way for me to\\nchip in and change the general tune.\\n\\nWell, blamed if the king didn\\'t bill the house and the niggers and all\\nthe property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;\\nbut anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\\n\\nSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls\\' joy\\ngot the first jolt. \\ufffdA couple of nigger traders come along, and the king\\nsold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called\\nit, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their\\nmother down the river to Orleans. \\ufffdI thought them poor girls and them\\nniggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each\\nother, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. \\ufffdThe girls\\nsaid they hadn\\'t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold\\naway from the town. \\ufffdI can\\'t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of\\nthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other\\'s necks\\nand crying; and I reckon I couldn\\'t a stood it all, but would a had\\nto bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn\\'t knowed the sale warn\\'t no\\naccount and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.\\n\\nThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out\\nflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the\\nchildren that way. \\ufffdIt injured the frauds some; but the old fool he\\nbulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell\\nyou the duke was powerful uneasy.\\n\\nNext day was auction day. \\ufffdAbout broad day in the morning the king and\\nthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look\\nthat there was trouble. \\ufffdThe king says:\\n\\n\"Was you in my room night before last?\"\\n\\n\"No, your majesty\"--which was the way I always called him when nobody but\\nour gang warn\\'t around.\\n\\n\"Was you in there yisterday er last night?\"\\n\\n\"No, your majesty.\"\\n\\n\"Honor bright, now--no lies.\"\\n\\n\"Honor bright, your majesty, I\\'m telling you the truth. \\ufffdI hain\\'t been\\na-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed\\nit to you.\"\\n\\nThe duke says:\\n\\n\"Have you seen anybody else go in there?\"\\n\\n\"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"Stop and think.\"\\n\\nI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\\n\\n\"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.\"\\n\\nBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn\\'t ever\\nexpected it, and then like they _had_. \\ufffdThen the duke says:\\n\\n\"What, all of them?\"\\n\\n\"No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don\\'t think I ever see them\\nall come _out_ at once but just one time.\"\\n\\n\"Hello! \\ufffdWhen was that?\"\\n\\n\"It was the day we had the funeral. \\ufffdIn the morning. \\ufffdIt warn\\'t early,\\nbecause I overslept. \\ufffdI was just starting down the ladder, and I see\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Well, go on, _go_ on! \\ufffdWhat did they do? \\ufffdHow\\'d they act?\"\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t do nothing. \\ufffdAnd they didn\\'t act anyway much, as fur as I\\nsee. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they\\'d shoved in\\nthere to do up your majesty\\'s room, or something, s\\'posing you was up;\\nand found you _warn\\'t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the\\nway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn\\'t already waked you\\nup.\"\\n\\n\"Great guns, _this_ is a go!\" says the king; and both of them looked\\npretty sick and tolerable silly. \\ufffdThey stood there a-thinking and\\nscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a\\nlittle raspy chuckle, and says:\\n\\n\"It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. \\ufffdThey let on\\nto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region! \\ufffdAnd I believed they\\n_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. \\ufffdDon\\'t ever tell _me_\\nany more that a nigger ain\\'t got any histrionic talent. \\ufffdWhy, the way\\nthey played that thing it would fool _anybody_. \\ufffdIn my opinion, there\\'s\\na fortune in \\'em. \\ufffdIf I had capital and a theater, I wouldn\\'t want a\\nbetter lay-out than that--and here we\\'ve gone and sold \\'em for a song.\\n\\ufffdYes, and ain\\'t privileged to sing the song yet. \\ufffdSay, where _is_ that\\nsong--that draft?\"\\n\\n\"In the bank for to be collected. \\ufffdWhere _would_ it be?\"\\n\\n\"Well, _that\\'s_ all right then, thank goodness.\"\\n\\nSays I, kind of timid-like:\\n\\n\"Is something gone wrong?\"\\n\\nThe king whirls on me and rips out:\\n\\n\"None o\\' your business! \\ufffdYou keep your head shet, and mind y\\'r own\\naffairs--if you got any. \\ufffdLong as you\\'re in this town don\\'t you forgit\\n_that_--you hear?\" \\ufffdThen he says to the duke, \"We got to jest swaller it\\nand say noth\\'n\\': \\ufffdmum\\'s the word for _us_.\"\\n\\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Quick sales _and_ small profits! \\ufffdIt\\'s a good business--yes.\"\\n\\nThe king snarls around on him and says:\\n\\n\"I was trying to do for the best in sellin\\' \\'em out so quick. \\ufffdIf the\\nprofits has turned out to be none, lackin\\' considable, and none to\\ncarry, is it my fault any more\\'n it\\'s yourn?\"\\n\\n\"Well, _they\\'d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn\\'t_ if I could a got\\nmy advice listened to.\"\\n\\nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped\\naround and lit into _me_ again. \\ufffdHe give me down the banks for not\\ncoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting\\nthat way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up. \\ufffdAnd then\\nwaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not\\nlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he\\'d be\\nblamed if he\\'d ever do it again. \\ufffdSo they went off a-jawing; and I felt\\ndreadful glad I\\'d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn\\'t\\ndone the niggers no harm by it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\nBY and by it was getting-up time. \\ufffdSo I come down the ladder and started\\nfor down-stairs; but as I come to the girls\\' room the door was open, and\\nI see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she\\'d\\nbeen packing things in it--getting ready to go to England. \\ufffdBut she\\nhad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her\\nhands, crying. \\ufffdI felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. \\ufffdI\\nwent in there and says:\\n\\n\"Miss Mary Jane, you can\\'t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I\\ncan\\'t--most always. \\ufffdTell me about it.\"\\n\\nSo she done it. \\ufffdAnd it was the niggers--I just expected it. \\ufffdShe said\\nthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn\\'t\\nknow _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and\\nthe children warn\\'t ever going to see each other no more--and then busted\\nout bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain\\'t _ever_ going to see each other any\\nmore!\"\\n\\n\"But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!\" says I.\\n\\nLaws, it was out before I could think! \\ufffdAnd before I could budge she\\nthrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it\\n_again_, say it _again_!\\n\\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close\\nplace. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very\\nimpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and\\neased-up, like a person that\\'s had a tooth pulled out. \\ufffdSo I went to\\nstudying it out. \\ufffdI says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells\\nthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,\\nthough I ain\\'t had no experience, and can\\'t say for certain; but it\\nlooks so to me, anyway; and yet here\\'s a case where I\\'m blest if it\\ndon\\'t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.\\n\\ufffdI must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it\\'s\\nso kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. \\ufffdWell, I\\nsays to myself at last, I\\'m a-going to chance it; I\\'ll up and tell the\\ntruth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of\\npowder and touching it off just to see where you\\'ll go to. Then I says:\\n\\n\"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you\\ncould go and stay three or four days?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Mr. Lothrop\\'s. \\ufffdWhy?\"\\n\\n\"Never mind why yet. \\ufffdIf I\\'ll tell you how I know the niggers will see\\neach other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how\\nI know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop\\'s and stay four days?\"\\n\\n\"Four days!\" she says; \"I\\'ll stay a year!\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" I says, \"I don\\'t want nothing more out of _you_ than just\\nyour word--I druther have it than another man\\'s kiss-the-Bible.\" \\ufffdShe\\nsmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, \"If you don\\'t mind it,\\nI\\'ll shut the door--and bolt it.\"\\n\\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you holler. \\ufffdJust set still and take it like a man. \\ufffdI got to\\ntell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it\\'s a\\nbad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain\\'t no help for\\nit. \\ufffdThese uncles of yourn ain\\'t no uncles at all; they\\'re a couple of\\nfrauds--regular dead-beats. \\ufffdThere, now we\\'re over the worst of it, you\\ncan stand the rest middling easy.\"\\n\\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal\\nwater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher\\nall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck\\nthat young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she\\nflung herself on to the king\\'s breast at the front door and he kissed\\nher sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face\\nafire like sunset, and says:\\n\\n\"The brute! \\ufffdCome, don\\'t waste a minute--not a _second_--we\\'ll have them\\ntarred and feathered, and flung in the river!\"\\n\\nSays I:\\n\\n\"Cert\\'nly. \\ufffdBut do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop\\'s, or--\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" she says, \"what am I _thinking_ about!\" she says, and set right\\ndown again. \\ufffd\"Don\\'t mind what I said--please don\\'t--you _won\\'t,_ now,\\n_will_ you?\" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that\\nI said I would die first. \\ufffd\"I never thought, I was so stirred up,\" she\\nsays; \"now go on, and I won\\'t do so any more. \\ufffdYou tell me what to do,\\nand whatever you say I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I says, \"it\\'s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I\\'m fixed so\\nI got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I\\ndruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would\\nget me out of their claws, and I\\'d be all right; but there\\'d be another\\nperson that you don\\'t know about who\\'d be in big trouble. \\ufffdWell, we\\ngot to save _him_, hain\\'t we? \\ufffdOf course. \\ufffdWell, then, we won\\'t blow on\\nthem.\"\\n\\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. \\ufffdI see how maybe I could\\nget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.\\nBut I didn\\'t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard\\nto answer questions but me; so I didn\\'t want the plan to begin working\\ntill pretty late to-night. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Miss Mary Jane, I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do, and you won\\'t have to stay\\nat Mr. Lothrop\\'s so long, nuther. \\ufffdHow fur is it?\"\\n\\n\"A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that \\'ll answer. \\ufffdNow you go along out there, and lay low\\ntill nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home\\nagain--tell them you\\'ve thought of something. \\ufffdIf you get here before\\neleven put a candle in this window, and if I don\\'t turn up wait _till_\\neleven, and _then_ if I don\\'t turn up it means I\\'m gone, and out of the\\nway, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get\\nthese beats jailed.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" she says, \"I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\\n\"And if it just happens so that I don\\'t get away, but get took up along\\nwith them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,\\nand you must stand by me all you can.\"\\n\\n\"Stand by you! indeed I will. \\ufffdThey sha\\'n\\'t touch a hair of your head!\"\\nshe says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said\\nit, too.\\n\\n\"If I get away I sha\\'n\\'t be here,\" I says, \"to prove these rapscallions\\nain\\'t your uncles, and I couldn\\'t do it if I _was_ here. \\ufffdI could swear\\nthey was beats and bummers, that\\'s all, though that\\'s worth something.\\nWell, there\\'s others can do that better than what I can, and they\\'re\\npeople that ain\\'t going to be doubted as quick as I\\'d be. \\ufffdI\\'ll tell you\\nhow to find them. \\ufffdGimme a pencil and a piece of paper. \\ufffdThere--\\'Royal\\nNonesuch, Bricksville.\\' \\ufffdPut it away, and don\\'t lose it. \\ufffdWhen the\\ncourt wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to\\nBricksville and say they\\'ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,\\nand ask for some witnesses--why, you\\'ll have that entire town down here\\nbefore you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. \\ufffdAnd they\\'ll come a-biling, too.\"\\n\\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. \\ufffdSo I says:\\n\\n\"Just let the auction go right along, and don\\'t worry. \\ufffdNobody don\\'t\\nhave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction\\non accounts of the short notice, and they ain\\'t going out of this till\\nthey get that money; and the way we\\'ve fixed it the sale ain\\'t going to\\ncount, and they ain\\'t going to get no money. \\ufffdIt\\'s just like the way\\nit was with the niggers--it warn\\'t no sale, and the niggers will be\\nback before long. \\ufffdWhy, they can\\'t collect the money for the _niggers_\\nyet--they\\'re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" she says, \"I\\'ll run down to breakfast now, and then I\\'ll start\\nstraight for Mr. Lothrop\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Deed, _that_ ain\\'t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,\" I says, \"by no manner\\nof means; go _before_ breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don\\'t know. \\ufffdWhat was it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s because you ain\\'t one of these leather-face people. \\ufffdI don\\'t\\nwant no better book than what your face is. \\ufffdA body can set down and\\nread it off like coarse print. \\ufffdDo you reckon you can go and face your\\nuncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--\"\\n\\n\"There, there, don\\'t! \\ufffdYes, I\\'ll go before breakfast--I\\'ll be glad to.\\nAnd leave my sisters with them?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; never mind about them. \\ufffdThey\\'ve got to stand it yet a while. \\ufffdThey\\nmight suspicion something if all of you was to go. \\ufffdI don\\'t want you to\\nsee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was\\nto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.\\n\\ufffdNo, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I\\'ll fix it with all of\\nthem. I\\'ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say\\nyou\\'ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or\\nto see a friend, and you\\'ll be back to-night or early in the morning.\"\\n\\n\"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won\\'t have my love given to\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, it sha\\'n\\'t be.\" \\ufffdIt was well enough to tell _her_ so--no\\nharm in it. \\ufffdIt was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it\\'s\\nthe little things that smooths people\\'s roads the most, down here below;\\nit would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn\\'t cost nothing. \\ufffdThen\\nI says: \\ufffd\"There\\'s one more thing--that bag of money.\"\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think\\n_how_ they got it.\"\\n\\n\"No, you\\'re out, there. \\ufffdThey hain\\'t got it.\"\\n\\n\"Why, who\\'s got it?\"\\n\\n\"I wish I knowed, but I don\\'t. \\ufffdI _had_ it, because I stole it from\\nthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I\\'m\\nafraid it ain\\'t there no more. \\ufffdI\\'m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I\\'m\\njust as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. \\ufffdI\\ncome nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I\\ncome to, and run--and it warn\\'t a good place.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, stop blaming yourself--it\\'s too bad to do it, and I won\\'t allow\\nit--you couldn\\'t help it; it wasn\\'t your fault. \\ufffdWhere did you hide it?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I\\ncouldn\\'t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that\\ncorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. \\ufffdSo\\nfor a minute I didn\\'t say nothing; then I says:\\n\\n\"I\\'d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don\\'t\\nmind letting me off; but I\\'ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and\\nyou can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop\\'s, if you want to. \\ufffdDo you\\nreckon that \\'ll do?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\nSo I wrote: \\ufffd\"I put it in the coffin. \\ufffdIt was in there when you was\\ncrying there, away in the night. \\ufffdI was behind the door, and I was\\nmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.\"\\n\\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by\\nherself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own\\nroof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it\\nto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the\\nhand, hard, and says:\\n\\n\"_Good_-bye. \\ufffdI\\'m going to do everything just as you\\'ve told me; and if\\nI don\\'t ever see you again, I sha\\'n\\'t ever forget you and I\\'ll think of\\nyou a many and a many a time, and I\\'ll _pray_ for you, too!\"--and she was\\ngone.\\n\\nPray for me! \\ufffdI reckoned if she knowed me she\\'d take a job that was more\\nnearer her size. \\ufffdBut I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that\\nkind. \\ufffdShe had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there\\nwarn\\'t no back-down to her, I judge. \\ufffdYou may say what you want to, but\\nin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in\\nmy opinion she was just full of sand. \\ufffdIt sounds like flattery, but it\\nain\\'t no flattery. \\ufffdAnd when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she\\nlays over them all. \\ufffdI hain\\'t ever seen her since that time that I see\\nher go out of that door; no, I hain\\'t ever seen her since, but I reckon\\nI\\'ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying\\nshe would pray for me; and if ever I\\'d a thought it would do any good\\nfor me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn\\'t a done it or bust.\\n\\nWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see\\nher go. \\ufffdWhen I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:\\n\\n\"What\\'s the name of them people over on t\\'other side of the river that\\nyou all goes to see sometimes?\"\\n\\nThey says:\\n\\n\"There\\'s several; but it\\'s the Proctors, mainly.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the name,\" I says; \"I most forgot it. \\ufffdWell, Miss Mary Jane she\\ntold me to tell you she\\'s gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of\\nthem\\'s sick.\"\\n\\n\"Which one?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it\\'s--\"\\n\\n\"Sakes alive, I hope it ain\\'t _Hanner_?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say it,\" I says, \"but Hanner\\'s the very one.\"\\n\\n\"My goodness, and she so well only last week! \\ufffdIs she took bad?\"\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t no name for it. \\ufffdThey set up with her all night, Miss Mary\\nJane said, and they don\\'t think she\\'ll last many hours.\"\\n\\n\"Only think of that, now! \\ufffdWhat\\'s the matter with her?\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:\\n\\n\"Mumps.\"\\n\\n\"Mumps your granny! \\ufffdThey don\\'t set up with people that\\'s got the\\nmumps.\"\\n\\n\"They don\\'t, don\\'t they? \\ufffdYou better bet they do with _these_ mumps.\\n\\ufffdThese mumps is different. \\ufffdIt\\'s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.\"\\n\\n\"How\\'s it a new kind?\"\\n\\n\"Because it\\'s mixed up with other things.\"\\n\\n\"What other things?\"\\n\\n\"Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and\\nyaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don\\'t know what all.\"\\n\\n\"My land! \\ufffdAnd they call it the _mumps_?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what Miss Mary Jane said.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?\"\\n\\n\"Why, because it _is_ the mumps. \\ufffdThat\\'s what it starts with.\"\\n\\n\"Well, ther\\' ain\\'t no sense in it. \\ufffdA body might stump his toe, and take\\npison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains\\nout, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull\\nup and say, \\'Why, he stumped his _toe_.\\' \\ufffdWould ther\\' be any sense\\nin that? _No_. \\ufffdAnd ther\\' ain\\'t no sense in _this_, nuther. \\ufffdIs it\\nketching?\"\\n\\n\"Is it _ketching_? \\ufffdWhy, how you talk. \\ufffdIs a _harrow_ catching--in the\\ndark? If you don\\'t hitch on to one tooth, you\\'re bound to on another,\\nain\\'t you? And you can\\'t get away with that tooth without fetching the\\nwhole harrow along, can you? \\ufffdWell, these kind of mumps is a kind of a\\nharrow, as you may say--and it ain\\'t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you\\ncome to get it hitched on good.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s awful, I think,\" says the hare-lip. \\ufffd\"I\\'ll go to Uncle\\nHarvey and--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" I says, \"I _would_. \\ufffdOf _course_ I would. \\ufffdI wouldn\\'t lose no\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. \\ufffdHain\\'t your uncles\\nobleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? \\ufffdAnd do you\\nreckon they\\'d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that\\njourney by yourselves? \\ufffd_you_ know they\\'ll wait for you. \\ufffdSo fur, so\\ngood. Your uncle Harvey\\'s a preacher, ain\\'t he? \\ufffdVery well, then; is a\\n_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive\\na _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? \\ufffdNow\\n_you_ know he ain\\'t. \\ufffdWhat _will_ he do, then? \\ufffdWhy, he\\'ll say, \\'It\\'s a\\ngreat pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they\\ncan; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,\\nand so it\\'s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months\\nit takes to show on her if she\\'s got it.\\' \\ufffdBut never mind, if you think\\nit\\'s best to tell your uncle Harvey--\"\\n\\n\"Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good\\ntimes in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane\\'s\\ngot it or not? \\ufffdWhy, you talk like a muggins.\"\\n\\n\"Well, anyway, maybe you\\'d better tell some of the neighbors.\"\\n\\n\"Listen at that, now. \\ufffdYou do beat all for natural stupidness. \\ufffdCan\\'t\\nyou _see_ that _they\\'d_ go and tell? \\ufffdTher\\' ain\\'t no way but just to not\\ntell anybody at _all_.\"\\n\\n\"Well, maybe you\\'re right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.\"\\n\\n\"But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she\\'s gone out a while,\\nanyway, so he won\\'t be uneasy about her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. \\ufffdShe says, \\'Tell them to\\ngive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I\\'ve run over\\nthe river to see Mr.\\'--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your\\nuncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--\"\\n\\n\"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can\\'t ever seem to\\nremember them, half the time, somehow. \\ufffdYes, she said, say she has run\\nover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy\\nthis house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had\\nit than anybody else; and she\\'s going to stick to them till they say\\nthey\\'ll come, and then, if she ain\\'t too tired, she\\'s coming home; and\\nif she is, she\\'ll be home in the morning anyway. \\ufffdShe said, don\\'t say\\nnothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which \\'ll be\\nperfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying\\nthe house; I know it, because she told me so herself.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and\\ngive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\\n\\nEverything was all right now. \\ufffdThe girls wouldn\\'t say nothing because\\nthey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther\\nMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of\\nDoctor Robinson. \\ufffdI felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I\\nreckoned Tom Sawyer couldn\\'t a done it no neater himself. \\ufffdOf course he\\nwould a throwed more style into it, but I can\\'t do that very handy, not\\nbeing brung up to it.\\n\\nWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end\\nof the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man\\nhe was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the\\nauctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little\\ngoody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing\\nfor sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.\\n\\nBut by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was\\nsold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. \\ufffdSo\\nthey\\'d got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was\\nfor wanting to swallow _everything_. \\ufffdWell, whilst they was at it a\\nsteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping\\nand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:\\n\\n\"_Here\\'s_ your opposition line! here\\'s your two sets o\\' heirs to old\\nPeter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\nTHEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a\\nnice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. \\ufffdAnd, my souls,\\nhow the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. \\ufffdBut I didn\\'t see no\\njoke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some\\nto see any. \\ufffdI reckoned they\\'d turn pale. \\ufffdBut no, nary a pale did\\n_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but\\njust went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that\\'s\\ngoogling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed\\ndown sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in\\nhis very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the\\nworld. \\ufffdOh, he done it admirable. \\ufffdLots of the principal people\\ngethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. \\ufffdThat old\\ngentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. \\ufffdPretty\\nsoon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an\\nEnglishman--not the king\\'s way, though the king\\'s _was_ pretty good for\\nan imitation. \\ufffdI can\\'t give the old gent\\'s words, nor I can\\'t imitate\\nhim; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\\n\\n\"This is a surprise to me which I wasn\\'t looking for; and I\\'ll\\nacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain\\'t very well fixed to meet it and\\nanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he\\'s broke his\\narm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the\\nnight by a mistake. \\ufffdI am Peter Wilks\\' brother Harvey, and this is his\\nbrother William, which can\\'t hear nor speak--and can\\'t even make signs to\\namount to much, now\\'t he\\'s only got one hand to work them with. \\ufffdWe are\\nwho we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can\\nprove it. But up till then I won\\'t say nothing more, but go to the hotel\\nand wait.\"\\n\\nSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and\\nblethers out:\\n\\n\"Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain\\'t_ it?--and very convenient, too,\\nfor a fraud that\\'s got to make signs, and ain\\'t learnt how. \\ufffdLost\\ntheir baggage! That\\'s _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the\\n_circumstances_!\"\\n\\nSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,\\nor maybe half a dozen. \\ufffdOne of these was that doctor; another one was\\na sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind\\nmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and\\nwas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and\\nthen and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone\\nup to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along\\nand listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the\\nking now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:\\n\\n\"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when\\'d you come to this\\ntown?\"\\n\\n\"The day before the funeral, friend,\" says the king.\\n\\n\"But what time o\\' day?\"\\n\\n\"In the evenin\\'--\\'bout an hour er two before sundown.\"\\n\\n\"_How\\'d_ you come?\"\\n\\n\"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, how\\'d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_\\'--in a\\ncanoe?\"\\n\\n\"I warn\\'t up at the Pint in the mornin\\'.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lie.\"\\n\\nSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an\\nold man and a preacher.\\n\\n\"Preacher be hanged, he\\'s a fraud and a liar. \\ufffdHe was up at the Pint\\nthat mornin\\'. \\ufffdI live up there, don\\'t I? \\ufffdWell, I was up there, and\\nhe was up there. \\ufffdI see him there. \\ufffdHe come in a canoe, along with Tim\\nCollins and a boy.\"\\n\\nThe doctor he up and says:\\n\\n\"Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\"\\n\\n\"I reckon I would, but I don\\'t know. \\ufffdWhy, yonder he is, now. \\ufffdI know\\nhim perfectly easy.\"\\n\\nIt was me he pointed at. \\ufffdThe doctor says:\\n\\n\"Neighbors, I don\\'t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if\\n_these_ two ain\\'t frauds, I am an idiot, that\\'s all. \\ufffdI think it\\'s our\\nduty to see that they don\\'t get away from here till we\\'ve looked into\\nthis thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. \\ufffdWe\\'ll take\\nthese fellows to the tavern and affront them with t\\'other couple, and I\\nreckon we\\'ll find out _something_ before we get through.\"\\n\\nIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king\\'s friends; so\\nwe all started. \\ufffdIt was about sundown. \\ufffdThe doctor he led me along by\\nthe hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\\n\\nWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\\nfetched in the new couple. \\ufffdFirst, the doctor says:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they\\'re\\nfrauds, and they may have complices that we don\\'t know nothing about.\\n\\ufffdIf they have, won\\'t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter\\nWilks left? \\ufffdIt ain\\'t unlikely. \\ufffdIf these men ain\\'t frauds, they won\\'t\\nobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove\\nthey\\'re all right--ain\\'t that so?\"\\n\\nEverybody agreed to that. \\ufffdSo I judged they had our gang in a pretty\\ntight place right at the outstart. \\ufffdBut the king he only looked\\nsorrowful, and says:\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain\\'t got no disposition\\nto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation\\no\\' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain\\'t there; you k\\'n send\\nand see, if you want to.\"\\n\\n\"Where is it, then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\\ninside o\\' the straw tick o\\' my bed, not wishin\\' to bank it for the few\\ndays we\\'d be here, and considerin\\' the bed a safe place, we not bein\\'\\nused to niggers, and suppos\\'n\\' \\'em honest, like servants in England.\\n\\ufffdThe niggers stole it the very next mornin\\' after I had went down\\nstairs; and when I sold \\'em I hadn\\'t missed the money yit, so they got\\nclean away with it. \\ufffdMy servant here k\\'n tell you \\'bout it, gentlemen.\"\\n\\nThe doctor and several said \"Shucks!\" and I see nobody didn\\'t altogether\\nbelieve him. \\ufffdOne man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. \\ufffdI said\\nno, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I\\nnever thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up\\nmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\\n\\ufffdThat was all they asked me. \\ufffdThen the doctor whirls on me and says:\\n\\n\"Are _you_ English, too?\"\\n\\nI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \"Stuff!\"\\n\\nWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had\\nit, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\\nsupper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and\\nkept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. \\ufffdThey\\nmade the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his\\'n;\\nand anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the\\nold gentleman was spinning truth and t\\'other one lies. \\ufffdAnd by and by\\nthey had me up to tell what I knowed. \\ufffdThe king he give me a left-handed\\nlook out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\\nright side. \\ufffdI begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\\nand all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn\\'t get pretty\\nfur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\\n\\n\"Set down, my boy; I wouldn\\'t strain myself if I was you. \\ufffdI reckon\\nyou ain\\'t used to lying, it don\\'t seem to come handy; what you want is\\npractice. \\ufffdYou do it pretty awkward.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,\\nanyway.\\n\\nThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\\n\\n\"If you\\'d been in town at first, Levi Bell--\" The king broke in and\\nreached out his hand, and says:\\n\\n\"Why, is this my poor dead brother\\'s old friend that he\\'s wrote so often\\nabout?\"\\n\\nThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\\npleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\\nand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\\n\\n\"That \\'ll fix it. \\ufffdI\\'ll take the order and send it, along with your\\nbrother\\'s, and then they\\'ll know it\\'s all right.\"\\n\\nSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\\nhis head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\\nand then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\\nduke looked sick. \\ufffdBut he took the pen and wrote. \\ufffdSo then the lawyer\\nturns to the new old gentleman and says:\\n\\n\"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\"\\n\\nThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn\\'t read it. \\ufffdThe lawyer looked\\npowerful astonished, and says:\\n\\n\"Well, it beats _me_\"--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\\nand examined them, and then examined the old man\\'s writing, and then\\n_them_ again; and then says: \\ufffd\"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\\nand here\\'s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn\\'t\\nwrite them\" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\\nyou, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here\\'s _this_ old\\ngentleman\\'s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn\\'t\\nwrite them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain\\'t properly _writing_ at\\nall. \\ufffdNow, here\\'s some letters from--\"\\n\\nThe new old gentleman says:\\n\\n\"If you please, let me explain. \\ufffdNobody can read my hand but my brother\\nthere--so he copies for me. \\ufffdIt\\'s _his_ hand you\\'ve got there, not mine.\"\\n\\n\"_Well_!\" says the lawyer, \"this _is_ a state of things. \\ufffdI\\'ve got some\\nof William\\'s letters, too; so if you\\'ll get him to write a line or so we\\ncan com--\"\\n\\n\"He _can\\'t_ write with his left hand,\" says the old gentleman. \\ufffd\"If he\\ncould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\\nand mine too. \\ufffdLook at both, please--they\\'re by the same hand.\"\\n\\nThe lawyer done it, and says:\\n\\n\"I believe it\\'s so--and if it ain\\'t so, there\\'s a heap stronger\\nresemblance than I\\'d noticed before, anyway. \\ufffdWell, well, well! \\ufffdI\\nthought we was right on the track of a solution, but it\\'s gone to grass,\\npartly. \\ufffdBut anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain\\'t either of \\'em\\nWilkses\"--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\\n\\nWell, what do you think? \\ufffdThat muleheaded old fool wouldn\\'t give in\\n_then_! Indeed he wouldn\\'t. \\ufffdSaid it warn\\'t no fair test. \\ufffdSaid his\\nbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn\\'t tried\\nto write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\\nhe put the pen to paper. \\ufffdAnd so he warmed up and went warbling and\\nwarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\\nsaying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ve thought of something. \\ufffdIs there anybody here that helped to lay\\nout my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it. \\ufffdWe\\'re both here.\"\\n\\nThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:\\n\\n\"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\"\\n\\nBlamed if the king didn\\'t have to brace up mighty quick, or he\\'d a\\nsqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\\nhim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\\nmost _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\\nnotice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\\n\\ufffdHe whitened a little; he couldn\\'t help it; and it was mighty still in\\nthere, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. \\ufffdSays\\nI to myself, _now_ he\\'ll throw up the sponge--there ain\\'t no more use.\\n\\ufffdWell, did he? \\ufffdA body can\\'t hardly believe it, but he didn\\'t. \\ufffdI reckon\\nhe thought he\\'d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\\nthey\\'d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\\n\\ufffdAnyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\\n\\n\"Mf! \\ufffdIt\\'s a _very_ tough question, _ain\\'t_ it! \\ufffd_yes_, sir, I k\\'n\\ntell you what\\'s tattooed on his breast. \\ufffdIt\\'s jest a small, thin, blue\\narrow--that\\'s what it is; and if you don\\'t look clost, you can\\'t see it.\\n\\ufffd_now_ what do you say--hey?\"\\n\\nWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\\ncheek.\\n\\nThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\\nhis eye lights up like he judged he\\'d got the king _this_ time, and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"There--you\\'ve heard what he said! \\ufffdWas there any such mark on Peter\\nWilks\\' breast?\"\\n\\nBoth of them spoke up and says:\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t see no such mark.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" says the old gentleman. \\ufffd\"Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\\nwas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\\nyoung), and a W, with dashes between them, so: \\ufffdP--B--W\"--and he marked\\nthem that way on a piece of paper. \\ufffd\"Come, ain\\'t that what you saw?\"\\n\\nBoth of them spoke up again, and says:\\n\\n\"No, we _didn\\'t_. \\ufffdWe never seen any marks at all.\"\\n\\nWell, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\\n\\n\"The whole _bilin_\\' of \\'m \\'s frauds! \\ufffdLe\\'s duck \\'em! le\\'s drown \\'em!\\nle\\'s ride \\'em on a rail!\" and everybody was whooping at once, and there\\nwas a rattling powwow. \\ufffdBut the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Gentlemen--gentle_men!_ \\ufffdHear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\\n_please_! \\ufffdThere\\'s one way yet--let\\'s go and dig up the corpse and look.\"\\n\\nThat took them.\\n\\n\"Hooray!\" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\\nand the doctor sung out:\\n\\n\"Hold on, hold on! \\ufffdCollar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\\n_them_ along, too!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do it!\" they all shouted; \"and if we don\\'t find them marks we\\'ll\\nlynch the whole gang!\"\\n\\nI _was_ scared, now, I tell you. \\ufffdBut there warn\\'t no getting away, you\\nknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\\ngraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\\ntown at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\\nevening.\\n\\nAs we went by our house I wished I hadn\\'t sent Mary Jane out of town;\\nbecause now if I could tip her the wink she\\'d light out and save me, and\\nblow on our dead-beats.\\n\\nWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\\nwildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\\nlightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\\nthe leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\\nwas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\\nwhat I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\\nif I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\\nsave me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\\nworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. \\ufffdIf they\\ndidn\\'t find them--\\n\\nI couldn\\'t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn\\'t think\\nabout nothing else. \\ufffdIt got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\\ntime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\\nwrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. \\ufffdHe\\ndragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\\n\\nWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\\nlike an overflow. \\ufffdAnd when they got to the grave they found they had\\nabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn\\'t\\nthought to fetch a lantern. \\ufffdBut they sailed into digging anyway by the\\nflicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a\\nmile off, to borrow one.\\n\\nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\\nstarted, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\\nbrisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took\\nno notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute\\nyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the\\nshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the\\ndark wiped it all out, and you couldn\\'t see nothing at all.\\n\\nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\\nsuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\\nscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it\\nwas awful. \\ufffdHines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\\nand I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\\npanting.\\n\\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,\\nand somebody sings out:\\n\\n\"By the living jingo, here\\'s the bag of gold on his breast!\"\\n\\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and\\ngive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit\\nout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain\\'t nobody can tell.\\n\\nI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all\\nto myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the\\nbuzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\\nthe thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\\n\\nWhen I struck the town I see there warn\\'t nobody out in the storm, so\\nI never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\\nmain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and\\nset it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and\\ndisappointed, I didn\\'t know why. \\ufffdBut at last, just as I was sailing by,\\n_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane\\'s window! and my heart swelled up\\nsudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind\\nme in the dark, and wasn\\'t ever going to be before me no more in this\\nworld. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.\\n\\nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the\\ntowhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first\\ntime the lightning showed me one that wasn\\'t chained I snatched it and\\nshoved. It was a canoe, and warn\\'t fastened with nothing but a rope.\\n\\ufffdThe towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the\\nmiddle of the river, but I didn\\'t lose no time; and when I struck the\\nraft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp\\nif I could afforded it. \\ufffdBut I didn\\'t. \\ufffdAs I sprung aboard I sung out:\\n\\n\"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! \\ufffdGlory be to goodness, we\\'re shut\\nof them!\"\\n\\nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so\\nfull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up\\nin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King\\nLear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and\\nlights out of me. \\ufffdBut Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and\\nbless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the\\nking and the duke, but I says:\\n\\n\"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! \\ufffdCut loose and\\nlet her slide!\"\\n\\nSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_\\nseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and\\nnobody to bother us. \\ufffdI had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack\\nmy heels a few times--I couldn\\'t help it; but about the third crack\\nI noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and\\nlistened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out\\nover the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and\\nmaking their skiff hum! \\ufffdIt was the king and the duke.\\n\\nSo I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was\\nall I could do to keep from crying.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\nWHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Tryin\\' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! \\ufffdTired of our company,\\nhey?\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"No, your majesty, we warn\\'t--_please_ don\\'t, your majesty!\"\\n\\n\"Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I\\'ll shake the\\ninsides out o\\' you!\"\\n\\n\"Honest, I\\'ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.\\n\\ufffdThe man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he\\nhad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry\\nto see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by\\nsurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go\\nof me and whispers, \\'Heel it now, or they\\'ll hang ye, sure!\\' and I lit\\nout. \\ufffdIt didn\\'t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn\\'t do nothing,\\nand I didn\\'t want to be hung if I could get away. \\ufffdSo I never stopped\\nrunning till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,\\nor they\\'d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the\\nduke wasn\\'t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was\\nawful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\nJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, \"Oh,\\nyes, it\\'s _mighty_ likely!\" and shook me up again, and said he reckoned\\nhe\\'d drownd me. \\ufffdBut the duke says:\\n\\n\"Leggo the boy, you old idiot! \\ufffdWould _you_ a done any different? \\ufffdDid\\nyou inquire around for _him_ when you got loose? \\ufffdI don\\'t remember it.\"\\n\\nSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in\\nit. But the duke says:\\n\\n\"You better a blame\\' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you\\'re\\nthe one that\\'s entitled to it most. \\ufffdYou hain\\'t done a thing from the\\nstart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky\\nwith that imaginary blue-arrow mark. \\ufffdThat _was_ bright--it was right\\ndown bully; and it was the thing that saved us. \\ufffdFor if it hadn\\'t been\\nfor that they\\'d a jailed us till them Englishmen\\'s baggage come--and\\nthen--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took \\'em to the\\ngraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the\\nexcited fools hadn\\'t let go all holts and made that rush to get a\\nlook we\\'d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,\\ntoo--longer than _we\\'d_ need \\'em.\"\\n\\nThey was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of\\nabsent-minded like:\\n\\n\"Mf! \\ufffdAnd we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!\"\\n\\nThat made me squirm!\\n\\n\"Yes,\" says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, \"_we_\\ndid.\"\\n\\nAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:\\n\\n\"Leastways, I did.\"\\n\\nThe duke says, the same way:\\n\\n\"On the contrary, I did.\"\\n\\nThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:\\n\\n\"Looky here, Bilgewater, what\\'r you referrin\\' to?\"\\n\\nThe duke says, pretty brisk:\\n\\n\"When it comes to that, maybe you\\'ll let me ask, what was _you_\\nreferring to?\"\\n\\n\"Shucks!\" says the king, very sarcastic; \"but I don\\'t know--maybe you was\\nasleep, and didn\\'t know what you was about.\"\\n\\nThe duke bristles up now, and says:\\n\\n\"Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame\\' fool?\\nDon\\'t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?\"\\n\\n\"_Yes_, sir! \\ufffdI know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lie!\"--and the duke went for him. \\ufffdThe king sings out:\\n\\n\"Take y\\'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!\"\\n\\nThe duke says:\\n\\n\"Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,\\nintending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig\\nit up, and have it all to yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;\\nif you didn\\'t put the money there, say it, and I\\'ll b\\'lieve you, and\\ntake back everything I said.\"\\n\\n\"You old scoundrel, I didn\\'t, and you know I didn\\'t. \\ufffdThere, now!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I b\\'lieve you. \\ufffdBut answer me only jest this one more--now\\n_don\\'t_ git mad; didn\\'t you have it in your mind to hook the money and\\nhide it?\"\\n\\nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t care if I _did_, I didn\\'t _do_ it, anyway. \\ufffdBut you not\\nonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.\"\\n\\n\"I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that\\'s honest. \\ufffdI won\\'t say\\nI warn\\'t goin\\' to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in\\nahead o\\' me.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lie! \\ufffdYou done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--\"\\n\\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\\n\\n\"\\'Nough!--I _own up!_\"\\n\\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier\\nthan what I was feeling before. \\ufffdSo the duke took his hands off and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"If you ever deny it again I\\'ll drown you. \\ufffdIt\\'s _well_ for you to set\\nthere and blubber like a baby--it\\'s fitten for you, after the way\\nyou\\'ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble\\neverything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own\\nfather. \\ufffdYou ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it\\nsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for \\'em.\\n\\ufffdIt makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_\\nthat rubbage. \\ufffdCuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make\\nup the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I\\'d got out of the Nonesuch\\nand one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!\"\\n\\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\\n\\n\"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn\\'t me.\"\\n\\n\"Dry up! \\ufffdI don\\'t want to hear no more out of you!\" says the duke. \\ufffd\"And\\n_now_ you see what you GOT by it. \\ufffdThey\\'ve got all their own money back,\\nand all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. \\ufffdG\\'long to bed, and\\ndon\\'t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long \\'s _you_ live!\"\\n\\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,\\nand before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an\\nhour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the\\nlovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other\\'s arms. \\ufffdThey\\nboth got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn\\'t get mellow\\nenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag\\nagain. \\ufffdThat made me feel easy and satisfied. \\ufffdOf course when they got\\nto snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\nWE dasn\\'t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along\\ndown the river. \\ufffdWe was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty\\nlong ways from home. \\ufffdWe begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on\\nthem, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. \\ufffdIt was the\\nfirst I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\\ndismal. \\ufffdSo now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they\\nbegun to work the villages again.\\n\\nFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn\\'t make enough\\nfor them both to get drunk on. \\ufffdThen in another village they started\\na dancing-school; but they didn\\'t know no more how to dance than a\\nkangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped\\nin and pranced them out of town. \\ufffdAnother time they tried to go at\\nyellocution; but they didn\\'t yellocute long till the audience got up and\\ngive them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. \\ufffdThey tackled\\nmissionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and\\na little of everything; but they couldn\\'t seem to have no luck. \\ufffdSo at\\nlast they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she\\nfloated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the\\nhalf a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\\n\\nAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in\\nthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.\\nJim and me got uneasy. \\ufffdWe didn\\'t like the look of it. \\ufffdWe judged they\\nwas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. \\ufffdWe turned it\\nover and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break\\ninto somebody\\'s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money\\nbusiness, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an\\nagreement that we wouldn\\'t have nothing in the world to do with such\\nactions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold\\nshake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we\\nhid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of\\na shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told\\nus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see\\nif anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (\"House to\\nrob, you _mean_,\" says I to myself; \"and when you get through robbing it\\nyou\\'ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the\\nraft--and you\\'ll have to take it out in wondering.\") And he said if he\\nwarn\\'t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and\\nwe was to come along.\\n\\nSo we stayed where we was. \\ufffdThe duke he fretted and sweated around, and\\nwas in a mighty sour way. \\ufffdHe scolded us for everything, and we couldn\\'t\\nseem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.\\nSomething was a-brewing, sure. \\ufffdI was good and glad when midday come\\nand no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_\\nchange on top of it. \\ufffdSo me and the duke went up to the village, and\\nhunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the\\nback room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers\\nbullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all\\nhis might, and so tight he couldn\\'t walk, and couldn\\'t do nothing to\\nthem. \\ufffdThe duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king\\nbegun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and\\nshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like\\na deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a\\nlong day before they ever see me and Jim again. \\ufffdI got down there all\\nout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:\\n\\n\"Set her loose, Jim! we\\'re all right now!\"\\n\\nBut there warn\\'t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. \\ufffdJim was\\ngone! \\ufffdI set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run\\nthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn\\'t\\nno use--old Jim was gone. \\ufffdThen I set down and cried; I couldn\\'t help\\nit. But I couldn\\'t set still long. \\ufffdPretty soon I went out on the road,\\ntrying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and\\nasked him if he\\'d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Whereabouts?\" says I.\\n\\n\"Down to Silas Phelps\\' place, two mile below here. \\ufffdHe\\'s a runaway\\nnigger, and they\\'ve got him. \\ufffdWas you looking for him?\"\\n\\n\"You bet I ain\\'t! \\ufffdI run across him in the woods about an hour or two\\nago, and he said if I hollered he\\'d cut my livers out--and told me to lay\\ndown and stay where I was; and I done it. \\ufffdBeen there ever since; afeard\\nto come out.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" he says, \"you needn\\'t be afeard no more, becuz they\\'ve got him.\\nHe run off f\\'m down South, som\\'ers.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good job they got him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I _reckon_! \\ufffdThere\\'s two hunderd dollars reward on him. \\ufffdIt\\'s\\nlike picking up money out\\'n the road.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I\\'d been big enough; I see him\\n_first_. Who nailed him?\"\\n\\n\"It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for\\nforty dollars, becuz he\\'s got to go up the river and can\\'t wait. \\ufffdThink\\no\\' that, now! \\ufffdYou bet _I\\'d_ wait, if it was seven year.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s me, every time,\" says I. \\ufffd\"But maybe his chance ain\\'t worth\\nno more than that, if he\\'ll sell it so cheap. \\ufffdMaybe there\\'s something\\nain\\'t straight about it.\"\\n\\n\"But it _is_, though--straight as a string. \\ufffdI see the handbill myself.\\n\\ufffdIt tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells\\nthe plantation he\\'s frum, below Newr_leans_. \\ufffdNo-sirree-_bob_, they\\nain\\'t no trouble \\'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. \\ufffdSay, gimme a\\nchaw tobacker, won\\'t ye?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t have none, so he left. \\ufffdI went to the raft, and set down in the\\nwigwam to think. \\ufffdBut I couldn\\'t come to nothing. \\ufffdI thought till I wore\\nmy head sore, but I couldn\\'t see no way out of the trouble. \\ufffdAfter all\\nthis long journey, and after all we\\'d done for them scoundrels, here it\\nwas all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because\\nthey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make\\nhim a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty\\ndirty dollars.\\n\\nOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to\\nbe a slave at home where his family was, as long as he\\'d _got_ to be a\\nslave, and so I\\'d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to\\ntell Miss Watson where he was. \\ufffdBut I soon give up that notion for two\\nthings: she\\'d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness\\nfor leaving her, and so she\\'d sell him straight down the river again;\\nand if she didn\\'t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\\nand they\\'d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he\\'d feel ornery and\\ndisgraced. And then think of _me_! \\ufffdIt would get all around that Huck\\nFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see\\nanybody from that town again I\\'d be ready to get down and lick his boots\\nfor shame. \\ufffdThat\\'s just the way: \\ufffda person does a low-down thing, and\\nthen he don\\'t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he\\ncan hide it, it ain\\'t no disgrace. \\ufffdThat was my fix exactly. The more I\\nstudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the\\nmore wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when\\nit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence\\nslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being\\nwatched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a\\npoor old woman\\'s nigger that hadn\\'t ever done me no harm, and now was\\nshowing me there\\'s One that\\'s always on the lookout, and ain\\'t a-going\\nto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,\\nI most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. \\ufffdWell, I tried the best I\\ncould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung\\nup wicked, and so I warn\\'t so much to blame; but something inside of me\\nkept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and\\nif you\\'d a done it they\\'d a learnt you there that people that acts as\\nI\\'d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\"\\n\\nIt made me shiver. \\ufffdAnd I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\\ncouldn\\'t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. \\ufffdSo\\nI kneeled down. \\ufffdBut the words wouldn\\'t come. \\ufffdWhy wouldn\\'t they? \\ufffdIt\\nwarn\\'t no use to try and hide it from Him. \\ufffdNor from _me_, neither. \\ufffdI\\nknowed very well why they wouldn\\'t come. \\ufffdIt was because my heart warn\\'t\\nright; it was because I warn\\'t square; it was because I was playing\\ndouble. \\ufffdI was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was\\nholding on to the biggest one of all. \\ufffdI was trying to make my mouth\\n_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write\\nto that nigger\\'s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\\nknowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. \\ufffdYou can\\'t pray a lie--I found\\nthat out.\\n\\nSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn\\'t know what to\\ndo. At last I had an idea; and I says, I\\'ll go and write the letter--and\\nthen see if I can pray. \\ufffdWhy, it was astonishing, the way I felt as\\nlight as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. \\ufffdSo I\\ngot a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down\\nand wrote:\\n\\nMiss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\\nPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\\nreward if you send.\\n\\n_Huck Finn._\\n\\nI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\\nfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. \\ufffdBut I didn\\'t do it\\nstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\\nhow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\\nand going to hell. \\ufffdAnd went on thinking. \\ufffdAnd got to thinking over our\\ntrip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: \\ufffdin the day\\nand in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\\na-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. \\ufffdBut somehow I\\ncouldn\\'t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\\nother kind. \\ufffdI\\'d see him standing my watch on top of his\\'n, \\'stead of\\ncalling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\\nI come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\\nup there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\\nme honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\\ngood he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\\nthe men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\\nthe best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he\\'s\\ngot now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\\n\\nIt was a close place. \\ufffdI took it up, and held it in my hand. \\ufffdI was\\na-trembling, because I\\'d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\\nI knowed it. \\ufffdI studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\\nsays to myself:\\n\\n\"All right, then, I\\'ll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up.\\n\\nIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. \\ufffdAnd I let\\nthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. \\ufffdI shoved the\\nwhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\\nwhich was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn\\'t. \\ufffdAnd\\nfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\\nand if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\\nlong as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\\n\\nThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\\nconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\\nsuited me. \\ufffdSo then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\\nthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\\nraft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. \\ufffdI slept the\\nnight through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\\nand put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\\nanother in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. \\ufffdI landed\\nbelow where I judged was Phelps\\'s place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\\nand then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\\nsunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\\nof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\\n\\nThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\\nit, \"Phelps\\'s Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\\nthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn\\'t\\nsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now. \\ufffdBut I didn\\'t mind,\\nbecause I didn\\'t want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\\nlay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\\nthe village, not from below. \\ufffdSo I just took a look, and shoved along,\\nstraight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\\nthe duke. \\ufffdHe was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\\nperformance--like that other time. \\ufffdThey had the cheek, them frauds! \\ufffdI\\nwas right on him before I could shirk. \\ufffdHe looked astonished, and says:\\n\\n\"Hel-_lo_! \\ufffdWhere\\'d _you_ come from?\" \\ufffdThen he says, kind of glad and\\neager, \"Where\\'s the raft?--got her in a good place?\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"Why, that\\'s just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\\n\\nThen he didn\\'t look so joyful, and says:\\n\\n\"What was your idea for asking _me_?\" he says.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\\nto myself, we can\\'t get him home for hours, till he\\'s soberer; so I went\\na-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. \\ufffdA man up and offered\\nme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\\na sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\\nand the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\\nalong, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\\nhim. \\ufffdWe didn\\'t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\\ncountry till we tired him out. \\ufffdWe never got him till dark; then we\\nfetched him over, and I started down for the raft. \\ufffdWhen I got there and\\nsee it was gone, I says to myself, \\'They\\'ve got into trouble and had to\\nleave; and they\\'ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I\\'ve got in\\nthe world, and now I\\'m in a strange country, and ain\\'t got no property\\nno more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;\\' so I set down and\\ncried. \\ufffdI slept in the woods all night. \\ufffdBut what _did_ become of the\\nraft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\"\\n\\n\"Blamed if I know--that is, what\\'s become of the raft. \\ufffdThat old fool had\\nmade a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\\nthe loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\\nwhat he\\'d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\\nfound the raft gone, we said, \\'That little rascal has stole our raft and\\nshook us, and run off down the river.\\'\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\\nworld, and the only property.\"\\n\\n\"We never thought of that. \\ufffdFact is, I reckon we\\'d come to consider him\\n_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\\nenough for him. \\ufffdSo when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\\nthere warn\\'t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\\nshake. And I\\'ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. \\ufffdWhere\\'s\\nthat ten cents? Give it here.\"\\n\\nI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\\nspend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\\nmoney I had, and I hadn\\'t had nothing to eat since yesterday. \\ufffdHe never\\nsaid nothing. \\ufffdThe next minute he whirls on me and says:\\n\\n\"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? \\ufffdWe\\'d skin him if he done\\nthat!\"\\n\\n\"How can he blow? \\ufffdHain\\'t he run off?\"\\n\\n\"No! \\ufffdThat old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money\\'s\\ngone.\"\\n\\n\"_Sold_ him?\" \\ufffdI says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and\\nthat was my money. \\ufffdWhere is he?--I want my nigger.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you can\\'t _get_ your nigger, that\\'s all--so dry up your\\nblubbering. Looky here--do you think _you\\'d_ venture to blow on us?\\n\\ufffdBlamed if I think I\\'d trust you. \\ufffdWhy, if you _was_ to blow on us--\"\\n\\nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\\nbefore. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to blow on nobody; and I ain\\'t got no time to blow, nohow.\\nI got to turn out and find my nigger.\"\\n\\nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\\nhis arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. \\ufffdAt last he says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you something. \\ufffdWe got to be here three days. \\ufffdIf you\\'ll\\npromise you won\\'t blow, and won\\'t let the nigger blow, I\\'ll tell you\\nwhere to find him.\"\\n\\nSo I promised, and he says:\\n\\n\"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--\" and then he stopped. \\ufffdYou see, he\\nstarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\\nstudy and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. \\ufffdAnd so he\\nwas. He wouldn\\'t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\\nthe way the whole three days. \\ufffdSo pretty soon he says:\\n\\n\"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\\nlives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days. \\ufffdAnd I\\'ll start this\\nvery afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"No you wont, you\\'ll start _now_; and don\\'t you lose any time about it,\\nneither, nor do any gabbling by the way. \\ufffdJust keep a tight tongue in\\nyour head and move right along, and then you won\\'t get into trouble with\\n_us_, d\\'ye hear?\"\\n\\nThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. \\ufffdI\\nwanted to be left free to work my plans.\\n\\n\"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\\nto. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\\nidiots don\\'t require documents--leastways I\\'ve heard there\\'s such down\\nSouth here. \\ufffdAnd when you tell him the handbill and the reward\\'s bogus,\\nmaybe he\\'ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\\ngetting \\'em out. \\ufffdGo \\'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\\nmind you don\\'t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\"\\n\\nSo I left, and struck for the back country. \\ufffdI didn\\'t look around, but I\\nkinder felt like he was watching me. \\ufffdBut I knowed I could tire him out\\nat that. \\ufffdI went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\\nI stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps\\'. \\ufffdI\\nreckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\\naround, because I wanted to stop Jim\\'s mouth till these fellows could\\nget away. \\ufffdI didn\\'t want no trouble with their kind. \\ufffdI\\'d seen all I\\nwanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\nWHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;\\nthe hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint\\ndronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and\\nlike everybody\\'s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers\\nthe leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it\\'s\\nspirits whispering--spirits that\\'s been dead ever so many years--and you\\nalways think they\\'re talking about _you_. \\ufffdAs a general thing it makes a\\nbody wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.\\n\\nPhelps\\' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they\\nall look alike. \\ufffdA rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out\\nof logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different\\nlength, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when\\nthey are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the\\nbig yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the\\nnap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,\\nwith the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes\\nbeen whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big\\nbroad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house\\nback of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t\\'other\\nside the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against\\nthe back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;\\nash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by\\nthe kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there\\nin the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away\\noff in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place\\nby the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then\\nthe cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.\\n\\nI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and\\nstarted for the kitchen. \\ufffdWhen I got a little ways I heard the dim hum\\nof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;\\nand then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the\\nlonesomest sound in the whole world.\\n\\nI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting\\nto Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for\\nI\\'d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth\\nif I left it alone.\\n\\nWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went\\nfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. \\ufffdAnd\\nsuch another powwow as they made! \\ufffdIn a quarter of a minute I was a kind\\nof a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of\\nfifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses\\nstretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you\\ncould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.\\n\\nA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her\\nhand, singing out, \"Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!\" and she\\nfetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,\\nand then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,\\nwagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t\\nno harm in a hound, nohow.\\n\\nAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger\\nboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their\\nmother\\'s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way\\nthey always do. \\ufffdAnd here comes the white woman running from the house,\\nabout forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick\\nin her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the\\nsame way the little niggers was doing. \\ufffdShe was smiling all over so she\\ncould hardly stand--and says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s _you_, at last!--_ain\\'t_ it?\"\\n\\nI out with a \"Yes\\'m\" before I thought.\\n\\nShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands\\nand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;\\nand she couldn\\'t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, \"You\\ndon\\'t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law\\nsakes, I don\\'t care for that, I\\'m so glad to see you! \\ufffdDear, dear, it\\ndoes seem like I could eat you up! \\ufffdChildren, it\\'s your cousin Tom!--tell\\nhim howdy.\"\\n\\nBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and\\nhid behind her. \\ufffdSo she run on:\\n\\n\"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get\\nyour breakfast on the boat?\"\\n\\nI said I had got it on the boat. \\ufffdSo then she started for the house,\\nleading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. \\ufffdWhen we got\\nthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on\\na little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:\\n\\n\"Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I\\'ve been hungry\\nfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it\\'s come\\nat last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. \\ufffdWhat kep\\'\\nyou?--boat get aground?\"\\n\\n\"Yes\\'m--she--\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say yes\\'m--say Aunt Sally. \\ufffdWhere\\'d she get aground?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t rightly know what to say, because I didn\\'t know whether the\\nboat would be coming up the river or down. \\ufffdBut I go a good deal on\\ninstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards\\nOrleans. That didn\\'t help me much, though; for I didn\\'t know the names\\nof bars down that way. \\ufffdI see I\\'d got to invent a bar, or forget the\\nname of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched\\nit out:\\n\\n\"It warn\\'t the grounding--that didn\\'t keep us back but a little. \\ufffdWe\\nblowed out a cylinder-head.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! anybody hurt?\"\\n\\n\"No\\'m. \\ufffdKilled a nigger.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. \\ufffdTwo years ago\\nlast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old\\nLally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. \\ufffdAnd\\nI think he died afterwards. \\ufffdHe was a Baptist. \\ufffdYour uncle Silas knowed\\na family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. \\ufffdYes, I\\nremember now, he _did_ die. \\ufffdMortification set in, and they had to\\namputate him. But it didn\\'t save him. \\ufffdYes, it was mortification--that\\nwas it. \\ufffdHe turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious\\nresurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. \\ufffdYour uncle\\'s been up\\nto the town every day to fetch you. And he\\'s gone again, not more\\'n an\\nhour ago; he\\'ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,\\ndidn\\'t you?--oldish man, with a--\"\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t see nobody, Aunt Sally. \\ufffdThe boat landed just at daylight,\\nand I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town\\nand out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too\\nsoon; and so I come down the back way.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'d you give the baggage to?\"\\n\\n\"Nobody.\"\\n\\n\"Why, child, it \\'ll be stole!\"\\n\\n\"Not where I hid it I reckon it won\\'t,\" I says.\\n\\n\"How\\'d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?\"\\n\\nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:\\n\\n\"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something\\nto eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers\\'\\nlunch, and give me all I wanted.\"\\n\\nI was getting so uneasy I couldn\\'t listen good. \\ufffdI had my mind on the\\nchildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump\\nthem a little, and find out who I was. \\ufffdBut I couldn\\'t get no show, Mrs.\\nPhelps kept it up and run on so. \\ufffdPretty soon she made the cold chills\\nstreak all down my back, because she says:\\n\\n\"But here we\\'re a-running on this way, and you hain\\'t told me a word\\nabout Sis, nor any of them. \\ufffdNow I\\'ll rest my works a little, and you\\nstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about \\'m all every\\none of \\'m; and how they are, and what they\\'re doing, and what they told\\nyou to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.\"\\n\\nWell, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. \\ufffdProvidence had stood by\\nme this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. \\ufffdI see it\\nwarn\\'t a bit of use to try to go ahead--I\\'d got to throw up my hand. \\ufffdSo\\nI says to myself, here\\'s another place where I got to resk the truth.\\n\\ufffdI opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind\\nthe bed, and says:\\n\\n\"Here he comes! \\ufffdStick your head down lower--there, that\\'ll do; you can\\'t\\nbe seen now. \\ufffdDon\\'t you let on you\\'re here. \\ufffdI\\'ll play a joke on him.\\nChildren, don\\'t you say a word.\"\\n\\nI see I was in a fix now. \\ufffdBut it warn\\'t no use to worry; there warn\\'t\\nnothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from\\nunder when the lightning struck.\\n\\nI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then\\nthe bed hid him. \\ufffdMrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:\\n\\n\"Has he come?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" says her husband.\\n\\n\"Good-_ness_ gracious!\" she says, \"what in the warld can have become of\\nhim?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t imagine,\" says the old gentleman; \"and I must say it makes me\\ndreadful uneasy.\"\\n\\n\"Uneasy!\" she says; \"I\\'m ready to go distracted! \\ufffdHe _must_ a come; and\\nyou\\'ve missed him along the road. \\ufffdI _know_ it\\'s so--something tells me\\nso.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Sally, I _couldn\\'t_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.\"\\n\\n\"But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say! \\ufffdHe must a come! \\ufffdYou must a\\nmissed him. \\ufffdHe--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t distress me any more\\'n I\\'m already distressed. \\ufffdI don\\'t know\\nwhat in the world to make of it. \\ufffdI\\'m at my wit\\'s end, and I don\\'t mind\\nacknowledging \\'t I\\'m right down scared. \\ufffdBut there\\'s no hope that he\\'s\\ncome; for he _couldn\\'t_ come and me miss him. \\ufffdSally, it\\'s terrible--just\\nterrible--something\\'s happened to the boat, sure!\"\\n\\n\"Why, Silas! \\ufffdLook yonder!--up the road!--ain\\'t that somebody coming?\"\\n\\nHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.\\nPhelps the chance she wanted. \\ufffdShe stooped down quick at the foot of the\\nbed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the\\nwindow there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and\\nI standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. \\ufffdThe old gentleman stared,\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Why, who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"Who do you reckon \\'t is?\"\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t no idea. \\ufffdWho _is_ it?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s _Tom Sawyer!_\"\\n\\nBy jings, I most slumped through the floor! \\ufffdBut there warn\\'t no time to\\nswap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on\\nshaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and\\ncry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,\\nand the rest of the tribe.\\n\\nBut if they was joyful, it warn\\'t nothing to what I was; for it was like\\nbeing born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. \\ufffdWell, they froze\\nto me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn\\'t\\nhardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the\\nSawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. \\ufffdAnd I\\nexplained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of\\nWhite River, and it took us three days to fix it. \\ufffdWhich was all right,\\nand worked first-rate; because _they_ didn\\'t know but what it would take\\nthree days to fix it. \\ufffdIf I\\'d a called it a bolthead it would a done\\njust as well.\\n\\nNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty\\nuncomfortable all up the other. \\ufffdBeing Tom Sawyer was easy and\\ncomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a\\nsteamboat coughing along down the river. \\ufffdThen I says to myself, s\\'pose\\nTom Sawyer comes down on that boat? \\ufffdAnd s\\'pose he steps in here any\\nminute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep\\nquiet?\\n\\nWell, I couldn\\'t _have_ it that way; it wouldn\\'t do at all. \\ufffdI must go\\nup the road and waylay him. \\ufffdSo I told the folks I reckoned I would go\\nup to the town and fetch down my baggage. \\ufffdThe old gentleman was for\\ngoing along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and\\nI druther he wouldn\\'t take no trouble about me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\nSO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a\\nwagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and\\nwaited till he come along. \\ufffdI says \"Hold on!\" and it stopped alongside,\\nand his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed\\ntwo or three times like a person that\\'s got a dry throat, and then says:\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t ever done you no harm. \\ufffdYou know that. \\ufffdSo, then, what you\\nwant to come back and ha\\'nt _me_ for?\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t come back--I hain\\'t been _gone_.\"\\n\\nWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn\\'t quite\\nsatisfied yet. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn\\'t on you. \\ufffdHonest injun\\nnow, you ain\\'t a ghost?\"\\n\\n\"Honest injun, I ain\\'t,\" I says.\\n\\n\"Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can\\'t somehow\\nseem to understand it no way. \\ufffdLooky here, warn\\'t you ever murdered _at\\nall?_\"\\n\\n\"No. \\ufffdI warn\\'t ever murdered at all--I played it on them. \\ufffdYou come in\\nhere and feel of me if you don\\'t believe me.\"\\n\\nSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me\\nagain he didn\\'t know what to do. \\ufffdAnd he wanted to know all about it\\nright off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it\\nhit him where he lived. \\ufffdBut I said, leave it alone till by and by; and\\ntold his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told\\nhim the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? \\ufffdHe\\nsaid, let him alone a minute, and don\\'t disturb him. \\ufffdSo he thought and\\nthought, and pretty soon he says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right; I\\'ve got it. \\ufffdTake my trunk in your wagon, and let on\\nit\\'s your\\'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the\\nhouse about the time you ought to; and I\\'ll go towards town a piece, and\\ntake a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;\\nand you needn\\'t let on to know me at first.\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"All right; but wait a minute. \\ufffdThere\\'s one more thing--a thing that\\n_nobody_ don\\'t know but me. \\ufffdAnd that is, there\\'s a nigger here that\\nI\\'m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss\\nWatson\\'s Jim.\"\\n\\nHe says:\\n\\n\"What! \\ufffdWhy, Jim is--\"\\n\\nHe stopped and went to studying. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"I know what you\\'ll say. \\ufffdYou\\'ll say it\\'s dirty, low-down business; but\\nwhat if it is? \\ufffdI\\'m low down; and I\\'m a-going to steal him, and I want\\nyou keep mum and not let on. \\ufffdWill you?\"\\n\\nHis eye lit up, and he says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll _help_ you steal him!\"\\n\\nWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. \\ufffdIt was the most\\nastonishing speech I ever heard--and I\\'m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell\\nconsiderable in my estimation. \\ufffdOnly I couldn\\'t believe it. \\ufffdTom Sawyer\\na _nigger-stealer!_\\n\\n\"Oh, shucks!\" \\ufffdI says; \"you\\'re joking.\"\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t joking, either.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" I says, \"joking or no joking, if you hear anything said\\nabout a runaway nigger, don\\'t forget to remember that _you_ don\\'t know\\nnothing about him, and I don\\'t know nothing about him.\"\\n\\nThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his\\nway and I drove mine. \\ufffdBut of course I forgot all about driving slow on\\naccounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too\\nquick for that length of a trip. \\ufffdThe old gentleman was at the door, and\\nhe says:\\n\\n\"Why, this is wonderful! \\ufffdWhoever would a thought it was in that mare\\nto do it? \\ufffdI wish we\\'d a timed her. \\ufffdAnd she hain\\'t sweated a hair--not\\na hair. It\\'s wonderful. \\ufffdWhy, I wouldn\\'t take a hundred dollars for that\\nhorse now--I wouldn\\'t, honest; and yet I\\'d a sold her for fifteen before,\\nand thought \\'twas all she was worth.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s all he said. \\ufffdHe was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.\\nBut it warn\\'t surprising; because he warn\\'t only just a farmer, he was\\na preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the\\nplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church\\nand schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was\\nworth it, too. \\ufffdThere was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and\\ndone the same way, down South.\\n\\nIn about half an hour Tom\\'s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt\\nSally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty\\nyards, and says:\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s somebody come! \\ufffdI wonder who \\'tis? \\ufffdWhy, I do believe it\\'s\\na stranger. \\ufffdJimmy\" (that\\'s one of the children) \"run and tell Lize to\\nput on another plate for dinner.\"\\n\\nEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger\\ndon\\'t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for\\ninterest, when he does come. \\ufffdTom was over the stile and starting for\\nthe house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we\\nwas all bunched in the front door. \\ufffdTom had his store clothes on, and an\\naudience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. \\ufffdIn them circumstances\\nit warn\\'t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was\\nsuitable. \\ufffdHe warn\\'t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,\\nhe come ca\\'m and important, like the ram. \\ufffdWhen he got a-front of us he\\nlifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box\\nthat had butterflies asleep in it and he didn\\'t want to disturb them,\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"No, my boy,\" says the old gentleman, \"I\\'m sorry to say \\'t your driver\\nhas deceived you; Nichols\\'s place is down a matter of three mile more.\\nCome in, come in.\"\\n\\nTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \"Too late--he\\'s out\\nof sight.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with\\nus; and then we\\'ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I _can\\'t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn\\'t think of it. \\ufffdI\\'ll\\nwalk--I don\\'t mind the distance.\"\\n\\n\"But we won\\'t _let_ you walk--it wouldn\\'t be Southern hospitality to do\\nit. Come right in.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _do_,\" says Aunt Sally; \"it ain\\'t a bit of trouble to us, not a\\nbit in the world. \\ufffdYou must stay. \\ufffdIt\\'s a long, dusty three mile, and\\nwe can\\'t let you walk. \\ufffdAnd, besides, I\\'ve already told \\'em to put on\\nanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn\\'t disappoint us. \\ufffdCome\\nright in and make yourself at home.\"\\n\\nSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be\\npersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger\\nfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made\\nanother bow.\\n\\nWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and\\neverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and\\nwondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,\\nstill talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the\\nmouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was\\ngoing on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of\\nher hand, and says:\\n\\n\"You owdacious puppy!\"\\n\\nHe looked kind of hurt, and says:\\n\\n\"I\\'m surprised at you, m\\'am.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re s\\'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am? \\ufffdI\\'ve a good notion to take\\nand--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?\"\\n\\nHe looked kind of humble, and says:\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t mean nothing, m\\'am. \\ufffdI didn\\'t mean no harm. \\ufffdI--I--thought you\\'d\\nlike it.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you born fool!\" \\ufffdShe took up the spinning stick, and it looked\\nlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.\\n\\ufffd\"What made you think I\\'d like it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know. \\ufffdOnly, they--they--told me you would.\"\\n\\n\"_They_ told you I would. \\ufffdWhoever told you\\'s _another_ lunatic. \\ufffdI\\nnever heard the beat of it. \\ufffdWho\\'s _they_?\"\\n\\n\"Why, everybody. \\ufffdThey all said so, m\\'am.\"\\n\\nIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her\\nfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:\\n\\n\"Who\\'s \\'everybody\\'? \\ufffdOut with their names, or ther\\'ll be an idiot\\nshort.\"\\n\\nHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, and I warn\\'t expecting it. \\ufffdThey told me to. \\ufffdThey all told\\nme to. \\ufffdThey all said, kiss her; and said she\\'d like it. \\ufffdThey all said\\nit--every one of them. \\ufffdBut I\\'m sorry, m\\'am, and I won\\'t do it no more--I\\nwon\\'t, honest.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t, won\\'t you? \\ufffdWell, I sh\\'d _reckon_ you won\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"No\\'m, I\\'m honest about it; I won\\'t ever do it again--till you ask me.\"\\n\\n\"Till I _ask_ you! \\ufffdWell, I never see the beat of it in my born days!\\n\\ufffdI lay you\\'ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask\\nyou--or the likes of you.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" he says, \"it does surprise me so. \\ufffdI can\\'t make it out, somehow.\\nThey said you would, and I thought you would. \\ufffdBut--\" He stopped and\\nlooked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye\\nsomewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman\\'s, and says, \"Didn\\'t\\n_you_ think she\\'d like me to kiss her, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b\\'lieve I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\nThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:\\n\\n\"Tom, didn\\'t _you_ think Aunt Sally \\'d open out her arms and say, \\'Sid\\nSawyer--\\'\"\\n\\n\"My land!\" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, \"you impudent\\nyoung rascal, to fool a body so--\" and was going to hug him, but he\\nfended her off, and says:\\n\\n\"No, not till you\\'ve asked me first.\"\\n\\nSo she didn\\'t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed\\nhim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he\\ntook what was left. \\ufffdAnd after they got a little quiet again she says:\\n\\n\"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. \\ufffdWe warn\\'t looking for _you_\\nat all, but only Tom. \\ufffdSis never wrote to me about anybody coming but\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s because it warn\\'t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,\" he\\nsays; \"but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me\\ncome, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a\\nfirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me\\nto by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. \\ufffdBut it\\nwas a mistake, Aunt Sally. \\ufffdThis ain\\'t no healthy place for a stranger\\nto come.\"\\n\\n\"No--not impudent whelps, Sid. \\ufffdYou ought to had your jaws boxed; I\\nhain\\'t been so put out since I don\\'t know when. \\ufffdBut I don\\'t care, I\\ndon\\'t mind the terms--I\\'d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to\\nhave you here. Well, to think of that performance! \\ufffdI don\\'t deny it, I\\nwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.\"\\n\\nWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and\\nthe kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven\\nfamilies--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that\\'s laid\\nin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\\nold cold cannibal in the morning. \\ufffdUncle Silas he asked a pretty long\\nblessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn\\'t cool it a bit,\\nneither, the way I\\'ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\\n\\ufffdThere was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\\nand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn\\'t no use, they\\ndidn\\'t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid\\nto try to work up to it. \\ufffdBut at supper, at night, one of the little\\nboys says:\\n\\n\"Pa, mayn\\'t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" says the old man, \"I reckon there ain\\'t going to be any; and you\\ncouldn\\'t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and\\nme all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the\\npeople; so I reckon they\\'ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town\\nbefore this time.\"\\n\\nSo there it was!--but I couldn\\'t help it. \\ufffdTom and me was to sleep in the\\nsame room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to\\nbed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the\\nlightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn\\'t believe anybody was\\ngoing to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn\\'t hurry up\\nand give them one they\\'d get into trouble sure.\\n\\nOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,\\nand how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn\\'t come back no more, and\\nwhat a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our\\nRoyal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had\\ntime to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of\\nit--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of\\npeople with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\\npans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;\\nand as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a\\nrail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was\\nall over tar and feathers, and didn\\'t look like nothing in the\\nworld that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\\nsoldier-plumes. \\ufffdWell, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for\\nthem poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn\\'t ever feel any\\nhardness against them any more in the world. \\ufffdIt was a dreadful thing to\\nsee. \\ufffdHuman beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.\\n\\nWe see we was too late--couldn\\'t do no good. \\ufffdWe asked some stragglers\\nabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\\ninnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\\nmiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and\\nthe house rose up and went for them.\\n\\nSo we poked along back home, and I warn\\'t feeling so brash as I was\\nbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though\\nI hadn\\'t done nothing. \\ufffdBut that\\'s always the way; it don\\'t make no\\ndifference whether you do right or wrong, a person\\'s conscience ain\\'t\\ngot no sense, and just goes for him anyway. \\ufffdIf I had a yaller dog that\\ndidn\\'t know no more than a person\\'s conscience does I would pison him.\\nIt takes up more room than all the rest of a person\\'s insides, and yet\\nain\\'t no good, nohow. \\ufffdTom Sawyer he says the same.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\nWE stopped talking, and got to thinking. \\ufffdBy and by Tom says:\\n\\n\"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! \\ufffdI bet I\\nknow where Jim is.\"\\n\\n\"No! \\ufffdWhere?\"\\n\\n\"In that hut down by the ash-hopper. \\ufffdWhy, looky here. \\ufffdWhen we was at\\ndinner, didn\\'t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What did you think the vittles was for?\"\\n\\n\"For a dog.\"\\n\\n\"So \\'d I. Well, it wasn\\'t for a dog.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because part of it was watermelon.\"\\n\\n\"So it was--I noticed it. \\ufffdWell, it does beat all that I never thought\\nabout a dog not eating watermelon. \\ufffdIt shows how a body can see and\\ndon\\'t see at the same time.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it\\nagain when he came out. \\ufffdHe fetched uncle a key about the time we got up\\nfrom table--same key, I bet. \\ufffdWatermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;\\nand it ain\\'t likely there\\'s two prisoners on such a little plantation,\\nand where the people\\'s all so kind and good. \\ufffdJim\\'s the prisoner. \\ufffdAll\\nright--I\\'m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn\\'t give shucks\\nfor any other way. \\ufffdNow you work your mind, and study out a plan to\\nsteal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we\\'ll take the one we like\\nthe best.\"\\n\\nWhat a head for just a boy to have! \\ufffdIf I had Tom Sawyer\\'s head I\\nwouldn\\'t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown\\nin a circus, nor nothing I can think of. \\ufffdI went to thinking out a plan,\\nbut only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right\\nplan was going to come from. \\ufffdPretty soon Tom says:\\n\\n\"Ready?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I says.\\n\\n\"All right--bring it out.\"\\n\\n\"My plan is this,\" I says. \\ufffd\"We can easy find out if it\\'s Jim in there.\\nThen get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the\\nisland. \\ufffdThen the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the\\nold man\\'s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river\\non the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and\\nJim used to do before. \\ufffdWouldn\\'t that plan work?\"\\n\\n\"_Work_? \\ufffdWhy, cert\\'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. \\ufffdBut it\\'s\\ntoo blame\\' simple; there ain\\'t nothing _to_ it. \\ufffdWhat\\'s the good of a\\nplan that ain\\'t no more trouble than that? \\ufffdIt\\'s as mild as goose-milk.\\n\\ufffdWhy, Huck, it wouldn\\'t make no more talk than breaking into a soap\\nfactory.\"\\n\\nI never said nothing, because I warn\\'t expecting nothing different; but\\nI knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn\\'t\\nhave none of them objections to it.\\n\\nAnd it didn\\'t. \\ufffdHe told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was\\nworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man\\nas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. \\ufffdSo I was satisfied,\\nand said we would waltz in on it. \\ufffdI needn\\'t tell what it was here,\\nbecause I knowed it wouldn\\'t stay the way, it was. \\ufffdI knowed he would be\\nchanging it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new\\nbullinesses wherever he got a chance. \\ufffdAnd that is what he done.\\n\\nWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\\nearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.\\nThat was the thing that was too many for me. \\ufffdHere was a boy that was\\nrespectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at\\nhome that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and\\nknowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,\\nwithout any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to\\nthis business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\\nbefore everybody. \\ufffdI _couldn\\'t_ understand it no way at all. \\ufffdIt was\\noutrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be\\nhis true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save\\nhimself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you reckon I know what I\\'m about? \\ufffdDon\\'t I generly know what I\\'m\\nabout?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"_Well_, then.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s all he said, and that\\'s all I said. \\ufffdIt warn\\'t no use to say any\\nmore; because when he said he\\'d do a thing, he always done it. \\ufffdBut I\\ncouldn\\'t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\\nlet it go, and never bothered no more about it. \\ufffdIf he was bound to have\\nit so, I couldn\\'t help it.\\n\\nWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to\\nthe hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. \\ufffdWe went through the yard\\nso as to see what the hounds would do. \\ufffdThey knowed us, and didn\\'t make\\nno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by\\nin the night. \\ufffdWhen we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\\nthe two sides; and on the side I warn\\'t acquainted with--which was the\\nnorth side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just\\none stout board nailed across it. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the ticket. \\ufffdThis hole\\'s big enough for Jim to get through if we\\nwrench off the board.\"\\n\\nTom says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as\\nplaying hooky. \\ufffdI should _hope_ we can find a way that\\'s a little more\\ncomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" I says, \"how \\'ll it do to saw him out, the way I done\\nbefore I was murdered that time?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s more _like_,\" he says. \\ufffd\"It\\'s real mysterious, and troublesome,\\nand good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that\\'s twice as long.\\n\\ufffdThere ain\\'t no hurry; le\\'s keep on looking around.\"\\n\\nBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\\njoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. \\ufffdIt was as long\\nas the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. \\ufffdThe door to it was at\\nthe south end, and was padlocked. \\ufffdTom he went to the soap-kettle and\\nsearched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\\nso he took it and prized out one of the staples. \\ufffdThe chain fell down,\\nand we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\\nand see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn\\'t no connection\\nwith it; and there warn\\'t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\\nsome old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\\n\\ufffdThe match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\\nthe door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. \\ufffdHe says;\\n\\n\"Now we\\'re all right. \\ufffdWe\\'ll _dig_ him out. \\ufffdIt \\'ll take about a week!\"\\n\\nThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have\\nto pull a buckskin latch-string, they don\\'t fasten the doors--but that\\nwarn\\'t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\\nclimb up the lightning-rod. \\ufffdBut after he got up half way about three\\ntimes, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\\nbusted his brains out, he thought he\\'d got to give it up; but after he\\nwas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\\ntime he made the trip.\\n\\nIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\\nto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it\\n_was_ Jim that was being fed. \\ufffdThe niggers was just getting through\\nbreakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim\\'s nigger was piling up\\na tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\\nleaving, the key come from the house.\\n\\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\\nall tied up in little bunches with thread. \\ufffdThat was to keep witches\\noff. \\ufffdHe said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\\nmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\\nstrange words and noises, and he didn\\'t believe he was ever witched so\\nlong before in his life. \\ufffdHe got so worked up, and got to running on so\\nabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he\\'d been a-going to do.\\n\\ufffdSo Tom says:\\n\\n\"What\\'s the vittles for? \\ufffdGoing to feed the dogs?\"\\n\\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\\nheave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\\n\\n\"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. \\ufffdCur\\'us dog, too. \\ufffdDoes you want to go en look at\\n\\'im?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\\n\\n\"You going, right here in the daybreak? \\ufffd_that_ warn\\'t the plan.\"\\n\\n\"No, it warn\\'t; but it\\'s the plan _now_.\"\\n\\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn\\'t like it much. \\ufffdWhen we got in\\nwe couldn\\'t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\\nenough, and could see us; and he sings out:\\n\\n\"Why, _Huck_! \\ufffdEn good _lan_\\'! ain\\' dat Misto Tom?\"\\n\\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. \\ufffdI didn\\'t know\\nnothing to do; and if I had I couldn\\'t a done it, because that nigger\\nbusted in and says:\\n\\n\"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\"\\n\\nWe could see pretty well now. \\ufffdTom he looked at the nigger, steady and\\nkind of wondering, and says:\\n\\n\"Does _who_ know us?\"\\n\\n\"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\"\\n\\n\"What _put_ it dar? \\ufffdDidn\\' he jis\\' dis minute sing out like he knowed\\nyou?\"\\n\\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s mighty curious. \\ufffd_Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?\\n\\ufffd_what_ did he sing out?\" And turns to me, perfectly ca\\'m, and says,\\n\"Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?\"\\n\\nOf course there warn\\'t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\\n\\n\"No; I ain\\'t heard nobody say nothing.\"\\n\\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Did you sing out?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah,\" says Jim; \"I hain\\'t said nothing, sah.\"\\n\\n\"Not a word?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, I hain\\'t said a word.\"\\n\\n\"Did you ever see us before?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah; not as I knows on.\"\\n\\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and\\nsays, kind of severe:\\n\\n\"What do you reckon\\'s the matter with you, anyway? \\ufffdWhat made you think\\nsomebody sung out?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s de dad-blame\\' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.\\n\\ufffdDey\\'s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos\\' kill me, dey sk\\'yers me so.\\n\\ufffdPlease to don\\'t tell nobody \\'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he\\'ll scole\\nme; \\'kase he say dey _ain\\'t_ no witches. \\ufffdI jis\\' wish to goodness he was\\nheah now--_den_ what would he say! \\ufffdI jis\\' bet he couldn\\' fine no way to\\ngit aroun\\' it _dis_ time. \\ufffdBut it\\'s awluz jis\\' so; people dat\\'s _sot_,\\nstays sot; dey won\\'t look into noth\\'n\\'en fine it out f\\'r deyselves, en\\nwhen _you_ fine it out en tell um \\'bout it, dey doan\\' b\\'lieve you.\"\\n\\nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn\\'t tell nobody; and told him to\\nbuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. \\ufffdIf I was to\\ncatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn\\'t give\\nhim up, I\\'d hang him.\" \\ufffdAnd whilst the nigger stepped to the door to\\nlook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim\\nand says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ever let on to know us. \\ufffdAnd if you hear any digging going on\\nnights, it\\'s us; we\\'re going to set you free.\"\\n\\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger\\ncome back, and we said we\\'d come again some time if the nigger wanted\\nus to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the\\nwitches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks\\naround then.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\nIT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down\\ninto the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how\\nto dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;\\nwhat we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that\\'s called\\nfox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a\\ndark place. \\ufffdWe fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down\\nto rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:\\n\\n\"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.\\nAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.\\n\\ufffdThere ain\\'t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a\\nwatchman. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. \\ufffdAnd\\nthere\\'s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his\\nbed: \\ufffdwhy, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off\\nthe chain. \\ufffdAnd Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the\\npunkin-headed nigger, and don\\'t send nobody to watch the nigger. \\ufffdJim\\ncould a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn\\'t be\\nno use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. \\ufffdWhy, drat it,\\nHuck, it\\'s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_\\nthe difficulties. \\ufffdWell, we can\\'t help it; we got to do the best we can\\nwith the materials we\\'ve got. Anyhow, there\\'s one thing--there\\'s more\\nhonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,\\nwhere there warn\\'t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was\\ntheir duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your\\nown head. \\ufffdNow look at just that one thing of the lantern. \\ufffdWhen you\\ncome down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern\\'s\\nresky. \\ufffdWhy, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,\\nI believe. \\ufffdNow, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to\\nmake a saw out of the first chance we get.\"\\n\\n\"What do we want of a saw?\"\\n\\n\"What do we _want_ of it? \\ufffdHain\\'t we got to saw the leg of Jim\\'s bed\\noff, so as to get the chain loose?\"\\n\\n\"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain\\noff.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if that ain\\'t just like you, Huck Finn. \\ufffdYou _can_ get up the\\ninfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. \\ufffdWhy, hain\\'t you ever read\\nany books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,\\nnor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? \\ufffdWho ever heard of getting a\\nprisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? \\ufffdNo; the way all the\\nbest authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just\\nso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can\\'t be found, and put some dirt and\\ngrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can\\'t see\\nno sign of it\\'s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.\\nThen, the night you\\'re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip\\noff your chain, and there you are. \\ufffdNothing to do but hitch your\\nrope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the\\nmoat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and\\nthere\\'s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and\\nfling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or\\nNavarre, or wherever it is. It\\'s gaudy, Huck. \\ufffdI wish there was a moat\\nto this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we\\'ll dig one.\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"What do we want of a moat when we\\'re going to snake him out from under\\nthe cabin?\"\\n\\nBut he never heard me. \\ufffdHe had forgot me and everything else. \\ufffdHe had\\nhis chin in his hand, thinking. \\ufffdPretty soon he sighs and shakes his\\nhead; then sighs again, and says:\\n\\n\"No, it wouldn\\'t do--there ain\\'t necessity enough for it.\"\\n\\n\"For what?\" \\ufffdI says.\\n\\n\"Why, to saw Jim\\'s leg off,\" he says.\\n\\n\"Good land!\" \\ufffdI says; \"why, there ain\\'t _no_ necessity for it. \\ufffdAnd what\\nwould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\"\\n\\n\"Well, some of the best authorities has done it. \\ufffdThey couldn\\'t get the\\nchain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. \\ufffdAnd a leg would\\nbe better still. \\ufffdBut we got to let that go. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t necessity\\nenough in this case; and, besides, Jim\\'s a nigger, and wouldn\\'t\\nunderstand the reasons for it, and how it\\'s the custom in Europe; so\\nwe\\'ll let it go. \\ufffdBut there\\'s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we\\ncan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. \\ufffdAnd we\\ncan send it to him in a pie; it\\'s mostly done that way. \\ufffdAnd I\\'ve et\\nworse pies.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\" I says; \"Jim ain\\'t got no use for a\\nrope ladder.\"\\n\\n\"He _has_ got use for it. \\ufffdHow _you_ talk, you better say; you don\\'t\\nknow nothing about it. \\ufffdHe\\'s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.\"\\n\\n\"What in the nation can he _do_ with it?\"\\n\\n\"_Do_ with it? \\ufffdHe can hide it in his bed, can\\'t he?\" \\ufffdThat\\'s what they\\nall do; and _he\\'s_ got to, too. \\ufffdHuck, you don\\'t ever seem to want to do\\nanything that\\'s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the\\ntime. S\\'pose he _don\\'t_ do nothing with it? ain\\'t it there in his bed,\\nfor a clew, after he\\'s gone? and don\\'t you reckon they\\'ll want clews?\\n\\ufffdOf course they will. \\ufffdAnd you wouldn\\'t leave them any? \\ufffdThat would be a\\n_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn\\'t_ it! \\ufffdI never heard of such a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I says, \"if it\\'s in the regulations, and he\\'s got to have\\nit, all right, let him have it; because I don\\'t wish to go back on no\\nregulations; but there\\'s one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up\\nour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we\\'re going to get into trouble\\nwith Aunt Sally, just as sure as you\\'re born. \\ufffdNow, the way I look at\\nit, a hickry-bark ladder don\\'t cost nothing, and don\\'t waste nothing,\\nand is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,\\nas any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain\\'t had no\\nexperience, and so he don\\'t care what kind of a--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I\\'d keep\\nstill--that\\'s what I\\'D do. \\ufffdWho ever heard of a state prisoner escaping\\nby a hickry-bark ladder? \\ufffdWhy, it\\'s perfectly ridiculous.\"\\n\\n\"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you\\'ll take my\\nadvice, you\\'ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\"\\n\\nHe said that would do. \\ufffdAnd that gave him another idea, and he says:\\n\\n\"Borrow a shirt, too.\"\\n\\n\"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.\"\\n\\n\"Journal your granny--_Jim_ can\\'t write.\"\\n\\n\"S\\'pose he _can\\'t_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can\\'t he, if\\nwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron\\nbarrel-hoop?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better\\none; and quicker, too.\"\\n\\n\"_Prisoners_ don\\'t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull\\npens out of, you muggins. \\ufffdThey _always_ make their pens out of the\\nhardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or\\nsomething like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks\\nand weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they\\'ve got\\nto do it by rubbing it on the wall. \\ufffd_They_ wouldn\\'t use a goose-quill\\nif they had it. It ain\\'t regular.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what\\'ll we make him the ink out of?\"\\n\\n\"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that\\'s the common sort\\nand women; the best authorities uses their own blood. \\ufffdJim can do that;\\nand when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message\\nto let the world know where he\\'s captivated, he can write it on the\\nbottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. \\ufffdThe\\nIron Mask always done that, and it\\'s a blame\\' good way, too.\"\\n\\n\"Jim ain\\'t got no tin plates. \\ufffdThey feed him in a pan.\"\\n\\n\"That ain\\'t nothing; we can get him some.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t nobody _read_ his plates.\"\\n\\n\"That ain\\'t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn. \\ufffdAll _he\\'s_ got to\\ndo is to write on the plate and throw it out. \\ufffdYou don\\'t _have_ to be\\nable to read it. Why, half the time you can\\'t read anything a prisoner\\nwrites on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what\\'s the sense in wasting the plates?\"\\n\\n\"Why, blame it all, it ain\\'t the _prisoner\\'s_ plates.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s _somebody\\'s_ plates, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, spos\\'n it is? \\ufffdWhat does the _prisoner_ care whose--\"\\n\\nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. \\ufffdSo we\\ncleared out for the house.\\n\\nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the\\nclothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went\\ndown and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. \\ufffdI called it borrowing,\\nbecause that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn\\'t\\nborrowing, it was stealing. \\ufffdHe said we was representing prisoners; and\\nprisoners don\\'t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody\\ndon\\'t blame them for it, either. \\ufffdIt ain\\'t no crime in a prisoner to\\nsteal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it\\'s his right; and\\nso, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to\\nsteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves\\nout of prison with. \\ufffdHe said if we warn\\'t prisoners it would be a very\\ndifferent thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when\\nhe warn\\'t a prisoner. \\ufffdSo we allowed we would steal everything there was\\nthat come handy. \\ufffdAnd yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,\\nwhen I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he\\nmade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it\\nwas for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we\\n_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. \\ufffdBut he said I didn\\'t\\nneed it to get out of prison with; there\\'s where the difference was.\\n\\ufffdHe said if I\\'d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim\\nto kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. \\ufffdSo I let it go at\\nthat, though I couldn\\'t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner\\nif I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like\\nthat every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.\\n\\nWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled\\ndown to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he\\ncarried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep\\nwatch. \\ufffdBy and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile\\nto talk. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"Everything\\'s all right now except tools; and that\\'s easy fixed.\"\\n\\n\"Tools?\" \\ufffdI says.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Tools for what?\"\\n\\n\"Why, to dig with. \\ufffdWe ain\\'t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?\"\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a\\nnigger out with?\" \\ufffdI says.\\n\\nHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:\\n\\n\"Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,\\nand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?\\n\\ufffdNow I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what\\nkind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero? \\ufffdWhy, they might as\\nwell lend him the key and done with it. \\ufffdPicks and shovels--why, they\\nwouldn\\'t furnish \\'em to a king.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" I says, \"if we don\\'t want the picks and shovels, what do\\nwe want?\"\\n\\n\"A couple of case-knives.\"\\n\\n\"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Confound it, it\\'s foolish, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference how foolish it is, it\\'s the _right_ way--and\\nit\\'s the regular way. \\ufffdAnd there ain\\'t no _other_ way, that ever I heard\\nof, and I\\'ve read all the books that gives any information about these\\nthings. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind\\nyou; generly it\\'s through solid rock. \\ufffdAnd it takes them weeks and weeks\\nand weeks, and for ever and ever. \\ufffdWhy, look at one of them prisoners in\\nthe bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that\\ndug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, guess.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. \\ufffdA month and a half.\"\\n\\n\"_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China. \\ufffd_That\\'s_ the kind. \\ufffdI\\nwish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.\"\\n\\n\"_Jim_ don\\'t know nobody in China.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s _that_ got to do with it? \\ufffdNeither did that other fellow. \\ufffdBut\\nyou\\'re always a-wandering off on a side issue. \\ufffdWhy can\\'t you stick to\\nthe main point?\"\\n\\n\"All right--I don\\'t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim\\ndon\\'t, either, I reckon. \\ufffdBut there\\'s one thing, anyway--Jim\\'s too old to\\nbe dug out with a case-knife. \\ufffdHe won\\'t last.\"\\n\\n\"Yes he will _last_, too. \\ufffdYou don\\'t reckon it\\'s going to take\\nthirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?\"\\n\\n\"How long will it take, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we can\\'t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn\\'t\\ntake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.\\n\\ufffdHe\\'ll hear Jim ain\\'t from there. \\ufffdThen his next move will be to\\nadvertise Jim, or something like that. \\ufffdSo we can\\'t resk being as long\\ndigging him out as we ought to. \\ufffdBy rights I reckon we ought to be\\na couple of years; but we can\\'t. \\ufffdThings being so uncertain, what I\\nrecommend is this: \\ufffdthat we really dig right in, as quick as we can;\\nand after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it\\nthirty-seven years. \\ufffdThen we can snatch him out and rush him away the\\nfirst time there\\'s an alarm. \\ufffdYes, I reckon that \\'ll be the best way.\"\\n\\n\"Now, there\\'s _sense_ in that,\" I says. \\ufffd\"Letting on don\\'t cost nothing;\\nletting on ain\\'t no trouble; and if it\\'s any object, I don\\'t mind\\nletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. \\ufffdIt wouldn\\'t strain\\nme none, after I got my hand in. \\ufffdSo I\\'ll mosey along now, and smouch a\\ncouple of case-knives.\"\\n\\n\"Smouch three,\" he says; \"we want one to make a saw out of.\"\\n\\n\"Tom, if it ain\\'t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,\" I says,\\n\"there\\'s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the\\nweather-boarding behind the smoke-house.\"\\n\\nHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. \\ufffdRun along and\\nsmouch the knives--three of them.\" \\ufffdSo I done it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\nAS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\\nlightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our\\npile of fox-fire, and went to work. \\ufffdWe cleared everything out of the\\nway, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. \\ufffdTom\\nsaid he was right behind Jim\\'s bed now, and we\\'d dig in under it, and\\nwhen we got through there couldn\\'t nobody in the cabin ever know there\\nwas any hole there, because Jim\\'s counter-pin hung down most to the\\nground, and you\\'d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.\\n\\ufffdSo we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then\\nwe was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn\\'t see\\nwe\\'d done anything hardly. \\ufffdAt last I says:\\n\\n\"This ain\\'t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,\\nTom Sawyer.\"\\n\\nHe never said nothing. \\ufffdBut he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped\\ndigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.\\nThen he says:\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t no use, Huck, it ain\\'t a-going to work. \\ufffdIf we was prisoners\\nit would, because then we\\'d have as many years as we wanted, and no\\nhurry; and we wouldn\\'t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while\\nthey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn\\'t get blistered, and\\nwe could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\\nand the way it ought to be done. \\ufffdBut _we_ can\\'t fool along; we got to\\nrush; we ain\\'t got no time to spare. \\ufffdIf we was to put in another\\nnight this way we\\'d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get\\nwell--couldn\\'t touch a case-knife with them sooner.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. \\ufffdIt ain\\'t right, and it ain\\'t moral, and I wouldn\\'t like\\nit to get out; but there ain\\'t only just the one way: \\ufffdwe got to dig him\\nout with the picks, and _let on_ it\\'s case-knives.\"\\n\\n\"_Now_ you\\'re _talking_!\" \\ufffdI says; \"your head gets leveler and leveler\\nall the time, Tom Sawyer,\" I says. \\ufffd\"Picks is the thing, moral or no\\nmoral; and as for me, I don\\'t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.\\n\\ufffdWhen I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school\\nbook, I ain\\'t no ways particular how it\\'s done so it\\'s done. \\ufffdWhat I\\nwant is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my\\nSunday-school book; and if a pick\\'s the handiest thing, that\\'s the thing\\nI\\'m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school\\nbook out with; and I don\\'t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks\\nabout it nuther.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" he says, \"there\\'s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like\\nthis; if it warn\\'t so, I wouldn\\'t approve of it, nor I wouldn\\'t stand by\\nand see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,\\nand a body ain\\'t got no business doing wrong when he ain\\'t ignorant and\\nknows better. \\ufffdIt might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,\\n_without_ any letting on, because you don\\'t know no better; but it\\nwouldn\\'t for me, because I do know better. \\ufffdGimme a case-knife.\"\\n\\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. \\ufffdHe flung it down, and\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Gimme a _case-knife_.\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t know just what to do--but then I thought. \\ufffdI scratched around\\namongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took\\nit and went to work, and never said a word.\\n\\nHe was always just that particular. \\ufffdFull of principle.\\n\\nSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\\nand made the fur fly. \\ufffdWe stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\\nlong as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\\nit. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\\nhis level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn\\'t come it, his\\nhands was so sore. \\ufffdAt last he says:\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t no use, it can\\'t be done. \\ufffdWhat you reckon I better do? \\ufffdCan\\'t\\nyou think of no way?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I says, \"but I reckon it ain\\'t regular. \\ufffdCome up the stairs, and\\nlet on it\\'s a lightning-rod.\"\\n\\nSo he done it.\\n\\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\\nfor to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\\nhung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\\nplates. \\ufffdTom says it wasn\\'t enough; but I said nobody wouldn\\'t ever see\\nthe plates that Jim throwed out, because they\\'d fall in the dog-fennel\\nand jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\\nhe could use them over again. \\ufffdSo Tom was satisfied. \\ufffdThen he says:\\n\\n\"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\"\\n\\n\"Take them in through the hole,\" I says, \"when we get it done.\"\\n\\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\\nof such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. \\ufffdBy and by he\\nsaid he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn\\'t no need to\\ndecide on any of them yet. \\ufffdSaid we\\'d got to post Jim first.\\n\\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\\none of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\\nJim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn\\'t wake him. \\ufffdThen we\\nwhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\\nthe job was done. \\ufffdWe crept in under Jim\\'s bed and into the cabin, and\\npawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\\nand found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\\nand gradual. \\ufffdHe was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us\\nhoney, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\\nhunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\\nand clearing out without losing any time. \\ufffdBut Tom he showed him how\\nunregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\\nand how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\\nnot to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\\n\\ufffdSo Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\\ntimes awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told\\nhim Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\\nSally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\\nboth of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\\n\\n\"_Now_ I know how to fix it. \\ufffdWe\\'ll send you some things by them.\"\\n\\nI said, \"Don\\'t do nothing of the kind; it\\'s one of the most jackass\\nideas I ever struck;\" but he never paid no attention to me; went right\\non. \\ufffdIt was his way when he\\'d got his plans set.\\n\\nSo he told Jim how we\\'d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\\nlarge things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\\nlookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\\nwe would put small things in uncle\\'s coat-pockets and he must steal them\\nout; and we would tie things to aunt\\'s apron-strings or put them in her\\napron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\\nwhat they was for. \\ufffdAnd told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\\nhis blood, and all that. He told him everything. \\ufffdJim he couldn\\'t see\\nno sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\\nbetter than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\\nas Tom said.\\n\\nJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\\nsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\\nbed, with hands that looked like they\\'d been chawed. \\ufffdTom was in high\\nspirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\\nmost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\\nkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\\nget out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\\nmore he got used to it. \\ufffdHe said that in that way it could be strung out\\nto as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. \\ufffdAnd he\\nsaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\\n\\nIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\\ncandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\\nhis pocket. \\ufffdThen we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat\\'s\\nnotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\\ncorn-pone that was in Jim\\'s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\\nit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\\nmashed all his teeth out; and there warn\\'t ever anything could a worked\\nbetter. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\\njust a piece of rock or something like that that\\'s always getting into\\nbread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\\njabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\\n\\nAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\\ncouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim\\'s bed; and they kept on\\npiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn\\'t hardly room\\nin there to get your breath. \\ufffdBy jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\\ndoor! \\ufffdThe nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and keeled\\nover on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\\ndying. \\ufffdTom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim\\'s meat,\\nand the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\\nagain and shut the door, and I knowed he\\'d fixed the other door too.\\nThen he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\\nasking him if he\\'d been imagining he saw something again. \\ufffdHe raised up,\\nand blinked his eyes around, and says:\\n\\n\"Mars Sid, you\\'ll say I\\'s a fool, but if I didn\\'t b\\'lieve I see most a\\nmillion dogs, er devils, er some\\'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese\\ntracks. \\ufffdI did, mos\\' sholy. \\ufffdMars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey\\nwas all over me. \\ufffdDad fetch it, I jis\\' wisht I could git my han\\'s on one\\ner dem witches jis\\' wunst--on\\'y jis\\' wunst--it\\'s all I\\'d ast. \\ufffdBut mos\\'ly\\nI wisht dey\\'d lemme \\'lone, I does.\"\\n\\nTom says:\\n\\n\"Well, I tell you what I think. \\ufffdWhat makes them come here just at this\\nrunaway nigger\\'s breakfast-time? \\ufffdIt\\'s because they\\'re hungry; that\\'s\\nthe reason. \\ufffdYou make them a witch pie; that\\'s the thing for _you_ to\\ndo.\"\\n\\n\"But my lan\\', Mars Sid, how\\'s I gwyne to make \\'m a witch pie? \\ufffdI doan\\'\\nknow how to make it. \\ufffdI hain\\'t ever hearn er sich a thing b\\'fo\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll have to make it myself.\"\\n\\n\"Will you do it, honey?--will you? \\ufffdI\\'ll wusshup de groun\\' und\\' yo\\' foot,\\nI will!\"\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll do it, seeing it\\'s you, and you\\'ve been good to us and\\nshowed us the runaway nigger. \\ufffdBut you got to be mighty careful. \\ufffdWhen\\nwe come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we\\'ve put in the\\npan, don\\'t you let on you see it at all. \\ufffdAnd don\\'t you look when Jim\\nunloads the pan--something might happen, I don\\'t know what. \\ufffdAnd above\\nall, don\\'t you _handle_ the witch-things.\"\\n\\n\"_Hannel \\'M_, Mars Sid? \\ufffdWhat _is_ you a-talkin\\' \\'bout? \\ufffdI wouldn\\'\\nlay de weight er my finger on um, not f\\'r ten hund\\'d thous\\'n billion\\ndollars, I wouldn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\nTHAT was all fixed. \\ufffdSo then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile\\nin the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces\\nof bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched\\naround and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as\\nwe could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full\\nof flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails\\nthat Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and\\nsorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt\\nSally\\'s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t\\'other we stuck\\nin the band of Uncle Silas\\'s hat, which was on the bureau, because we\\nheard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger\\'s\\nhouse this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the\\npewter spoon in Uncle Silas\\'s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn\\'t come\\nyet, so we had to wait a little while.\\n\\nAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn\\'t hardly\\nwait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one\\nhand and cracking the handiest child\\'s head with her thimble with the\\nother, and says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ve hunted high and I\\'ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_\\nbecome of your other shirt.\"\\n\\nMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard\\npiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the\\nroad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the\\nchildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry\\nout of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around\\nthe gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for\\nabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out\\nfor half price if there was a bidder. \\ufffdBut after that we was all right\\nagain--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.\\nUncle Silas he says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s most uncommon curious, I can\\'t understand it. \\ufffdI know perfectly\\nwell I took it _off_, because--\"\\n\\n\"Because you hain\\'t got but one _on_. \\ufffdJust _listen_ at the man! \\ufffdI know\\nyou took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering\\nmemory, too, because it was on the clo\\'s-line yesterday--I see it there\\nmyself. But it\\'s gone, that\\'s the long and the short of it, and you\\'ll\\njust have to change to a red flann\\'l one till I can get time to make a\\nnew one. And it \\'ll be the third I\\'ve made in two years. \\ufffdIt just keeps\\na body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to\\n_do_ with \\'m all is more\\'n I can make out. \\ufffdA body \\'d think you _would_\\nlearn to take some sort of care of \\'em at your time of life.\"\\n\\n\"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. \\ufffdBut it oughtn\\'t to be\\naltogether my fault, because, you know, I don\\'t see them nor have\\nnothing to do with them except when they\\'re on me; and I don\\'t believe\\nI\\'ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it ain\\'t _your_ fault if you haven\\'t, Silas; you\\'d a done it\\nif you could, I reckon. \\ufffdAnd the shirt ain\\'t all that\\'s gone, nuther.\\n\\ufffdTher\\'s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain\\'t all. \\ufffdThere was ten, and now\\nther\\'s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never\\ntook the spoon, _that\\'s_ certain.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what else is gone, Sally?\"\\n\\n\"Ther\\'s six _candles_ gone--that\\'s what. \\ufffdThe rats could a got the\\ncandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don\\'t walk off with the\\nwhole place, the way you\\'re always going to stop their holes and don\\'t\\ndo it; and if they warn\\'t fools they\\'d sleep in your hair, Silas--_you\\'d_\\nnever find it out; but you can\\'t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Sally, I\\'m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I\\'ve been remiss; but\\nI won\\'t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I wouldn\\'t hurry; next year \\'ll do. \\ufffdMatilda Angelina Araminta\\n_Phelps!_\"\\n\\nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the\\nsugar-bowl without fooling around any. \\ufffdJust then the nigger woman steps\\non to the passage, and says:\\n\\n\"Missus, dey\\'s a sheet gone.\"\\n\\n\"A _sheet_ gone! \\ufffdWell, for the land\\'s sake!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll stop up them holes to-day,\" says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\\n\\n\"Oh, _do_ shet up!--s\\'pose the rats took the _sheet_? \\ufffd_where\\'s_ it gone,\\nLize?\"\\n\\n\"Clah to goodness I hain\\'t no notion, Miss\\' Sally. \\ufffdShe wuz on de\\nclo\\'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: \\ufffdshe ain\\' dah no mo\\' now.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end. \\ufffdI _never_ see the beat of it\\nin all my born days. \\ufffdA shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--\"\\n\\n\"Missus,\" comes a young yaller wench, \"dey\\'s a brass cannelstick\\nmiss\\'n.\"\\n\\n\"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I\\'ll take a skillet to ye!\"\\n\\nWell, she was just a-biling. \\ufffdI begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned\\nI would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. \\ufffdShe\\nkept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and\\neverybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking\\nkind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. \\ufffdShe stopped,\\nwith her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in\\nJeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s _just_ as I expected. \\ufffdSo you had it in your pocket all the time;\\nand like as not you\\'ve got the other things there, too. \\ufffdHow\\'d it get\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\"I reely don\\'t know, Sally,\" he says, kind of apologizing, \"or you know\\nI would tell. \\ufffdI was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before\\nbreakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put\\nmy Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain\\'t in; but\\nI\\'ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I\\'ll know I\\ndidn\\'t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and\\ntook up the spoon, and--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, for the land\\'s sake! \\ufffdGive a body a rest! \\ufffdGo \\'long now, the whole\\nkit and biling of ye; and don\\'t come nigh me again till I\\'ve got back my\\npeace of mind.\"\\n\\nI\\'D a heard her if she\\'d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it\\nout; and I\\'d a got up and obeyed her if I\\'d a been dead. \\ufffdAs we was\\npassing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the\\nshingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and\\nlaid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. \\ufffdTom\\nsee him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:\\n\\n\"Well, it ain\\'t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain\\'t\\nreliable.\" Then he says: \\ufffd\"But he done us a good turn with the spoon,\\nanyway, without knowing it, and so we\\'ll go and do him one without _him_\\nknowing it--stop up his rat-holes.\"\\n\\nThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole\\nhour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. \\ufffdThen we heard\\nsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes\\nthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t\\'other,\\nlooking as absent-minded as year before last. \\ufffdHe went a mooning around,\\nfirst to one rat-hole and then another, till he\\'d been to them all.\\n\\ufffdThen he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle\\nand thinking. \\ufffdThen he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"Well, for the life of me I can\\'t remember when I done it. \\ufffdI could\\nshow her now that I warn\\'t to blame on account of the rats. \\ufffdBut never\\nmind--let it go. \\ufffdI reckon it wouldn\\'t do no good.\"\\n\\nAnd so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. \\ufffdHe was a\\nmighty nice old man. \\ufffdAnd always is.\\n\\nTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said\\nwe\\'d got to have it; so he took a think. \\ufffdWhen he had ciphered it out\\nhe told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\\nspoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\\ncounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\\nthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:\\n\\n\"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain\\'t but nine spoons _yet_.\"\\n\\nShe says:\\n\\n\"Go \\'long to your play, and don\\'t bother me. \\ufffdI know better, I counted\\n\\'m myself.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can\\'t make but nine.\"\\n\\nShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody\\nwould.\\n\\n\"I declare to gracious ther\\' _ain\\'t_ but nine!\" she says. \\ufffd\"Why, what in\\nthe world--plague _take_ the things, I\\'ll count \\'m again.\"\\n\\nSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\\nsays:\\n\\n\"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther\\'s _ten_ now!\" and she looked huffy\\nand bothered both. \\ufffdBut Tom says:\\n\\n\"Why, Aunty, I don\\'t think there\\'s ten.\"\\n\\n\"You numskull, didn\\'t you see me _count \\'m?_\"\\n\\n\"I know, but--\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll count \\'m _again_.\"\\n\\nSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\\n\\ufffdWell, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\\nmad. \\ufffdBut she counted and counted till she got that addled she\\'d start\\nto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\\ncome out right, and three times they come out wrong. \\ufffdThen she grabbed\\nup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\\ngalley-west; and she said cle\\'r out and let her have some peace, and if\\nwe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she\\'d skin\\nus. \\ufffdSo we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\\nshe was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\\nwith her shingle nail, before noon. \\ufffdWe was very well satisfied with\\nthis business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\\nbecause he said _now_ she couldn\\'t ever count them spoons twice alike\\nagain to save her life; and wouldn\\'t believe she\\'d counted them right if\\nshe _did_; and said that after she\\'d about counted her head off for the\\nnext three days he judged she\\'d give it up and offer to kill anybody\\nthat wanted her to ever count them any more.\\n\\nSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\\nher closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\\ncouple of days till she didn\\'t know how many sheets she had any more,\\nand she didn\\'t _care_, and warn\\'t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\\nsoul out about it, and wouldn\\'t count them again not to save her life;\\nshe druther die first.\\n\\nSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\\nand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\\ncounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn\\'t no consequence, it would\\nblow over by and by.\\n\\nBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. \\ufffdWe\\nfixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\\ndone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\\nhad to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\\nwe got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\\nthe smoke; because, you see, we didn\\'t want nothing but a crust, and we\\ncouldn\\'t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. \\ufffdBut of course\\nwe thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\\nin the pie. \\ufffdSo then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\\nup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\\nbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\\nwith. \\ufffdWe let on it took nine months to make it.\\n\\nAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn\\'t go\\ninto the pie. \\ufffdBeing made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\\nenough for forty pies if we\\'d a wanted them, and plenty left over\\nfor soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. \\ufffdWe could a had a whole\\ndinner.\\n\\nBut we didn\\'t need it. \\ufffdAll we needed was just enough for the pie, and\\nso we throwed the rest away. \\ufffdWe didn\\'t cook none of the pies in the\\nwash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\\nbrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged\\nto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from\\nEngland with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early\\nships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things\\nthat was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they\\nwarn\\'t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked\\nher out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first\\npies, because we didn\\'t know how, but she come up smiling on the last\\none. \\ufffdWe took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\\nloaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the\\nlid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\\nhandle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\\npie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would\\nwant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope\\nladder wouldn\\'t cramp him down to business I don\\'t know nothing what I\\'m\\ntalking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next\\ntime, too.\\n\\nNat didn\\'t look when we put the witch pie in Jim\\'s pan; and we put the\\nthree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim\\ngot everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted\\ninto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,\\nand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the\\nwindow-hole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\nMAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim\\nallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. \\ufffdThat\\'s the\\none which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. \\ufffdBut he had to have\\nit; Tom said he\\'d _got_ to; there warn\\'t no case of a state prisoner not\\nscrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\\n\\n\"Look at Lady Jane Grey,\" he says; \"look at Gilford Dudley; look at old\\nNorthumberland! \\ufffdWhy, Huck, s\\'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what\\nyou going to do?--how you going to get around it? \\ufffdJim\\'s _got_ to do his\\ninscription and coat of arms. \\ufffdThey all do.\"\\n\\nJim says:\\n\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I hain\\'t got no coat o\\' arm; I hain\\'t got nuffn but dish\\nyer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I says, \"Jim\\'s right, anyway, when he says he ain\\'t got no coat\\nof arms, because he hain\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon I knowed that,\" Tom says, \"but you bet he\\'ll have one before\\nhe goes out of this--because he\\'s going out _right_, and there ain\\'t\\ngoing to be no flaws in his record.\"\\n\\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim\\na-making his\\'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,\\nTom set to work to think out the coat of arms. \\ufffdBy and by he said he\\'d\\nstruck so many good ones he didn\\'t hardly know which to take, but there\\nwas one which he reckoned he\\'d decide on. \\ufffdHe says:\\n\\n\"On the scutcheon we\\'ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire\\n_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under\\nhis foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a\\nchief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the\\nnombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,\\n_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a\\ncouple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore\\nFretta, Minore Otto._ \\ufffdGot it out of a book--means the more haste the\\nless speed.\"\\n\\n\"Geewhillikins,\" I says, \"but what does the rest of it mean?\"\\n\\n\"We ain\\'t got no time to bother over that,\" he says; \"we got to dig in\\nlike all git-out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, anyway,\" I says, \"what\\'s _some_ of it? \\ufffdWhat\\'s a fess?\"\\n\\n\"A fess--a fess is--_you_ don\\'t need to know what a fess is. \\ufffdI\\'ll show\\nhim how to make it when he gets to it.\"\\n\\n\"Shucks, Tom,\" I says, \"I think you might tell a person. \\ufffdWhat\\'s a bar\\nsinister?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know. \\ufffdBut he\\'s got to have it. \\ufffdAll the nobility does.\"\\n\\nThat was just his way. \\ufffdIf it didn\\'t suit him to explain a thing to you,\\nhe wouldn\\'t do it. \\ufffdYou might pump at him a week, it wouldn\\'t make no\\ndifference.\\n\\nHe\\'d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to\\nfinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a\\nmournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done. \\ufffdHe\\nmade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\\n\\n1. \\ufffdHere a captive heart busted. 2. \\ufffdHere a poor prisoner, forsook by\\nthe world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. \\ufffdHere a lonely\\nheart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven\\nyears of solitary captivity. 4. \\ufffdHere, homeless and friendless, after\\nthirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,\\nnatural son of Louis XIV.\\n\\nTom\\'s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.\\nWhen he got done he couldn\\'t no way make up his mind which one for Jim\\nto scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed\\nhe would let him scrabble them all on. \\ufffdJim said it would take him a\\nyear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he\\ndidn\\'t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block\\nthem out for him, and then he wouldn\\'t have nothing to do but just\\nfollow the lines. \\ufffdThen pretty soon he says:\\n\\n\"Come to think, the logs ain\\'t a-going to do; they don\\'t have log walls\\nin a dungeon: \\ufffdwe got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. \\ufffdWe\\'ll fetch\\na rock.\"\\n\\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him\\nsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn\\'t ever get out.\\n\\ufffdBut Tom said he would let me help him do it. \\ufffdThen he took a look to\\nsee how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. \\ufffdIt was most pesky\\ntedious hard work and slow, and didn\\'t give my hands no show to get\\nwell of the sores, and we didn\\'t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom\\nsays:\\n\\n\"I know how to fix it. \\ufffdWe got to have a rock for the coat of arms and\\nmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.\\nThere\\'s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we\\'ll smouch it,\\nand carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,\\ntoo.\"\\n\\nIt warn\\'t no slouch of an idea; and it warn\\'t no slouch of a grindstone\\nnuther; but we allowed we\\'d tackle it. \\ufffdIt warn\\'t quite midnight yet,\\nso we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. \\ufffdWe smouched the\\ngrindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough\\njob. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn\\'t keep her from falling\\nover, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. \\ufffdTom said she was\\ngoing to get one of us, sure, before we got through. \\ufffdWe got her half\\nway; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. \\ufffdWe\\nsee it warn\\'t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his\\nbed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round\\nhis neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim\\nand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and\\nTom superintended. \\ufffdHe could out-superintend any boy I ever see. \\ufffdHe\\nknowed how to do everything.\\n\\nOur hole was pretty big, but it warn\\'t big enough to get the grindstone\\nthrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. \\ufffdThen Tom\\nmarked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,\\nwith the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the\\nlean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle\\nquit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under\\nhis straw tick and sleep on it. \\ufffdThen we helped him fix his chain back\\non the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. \\ufffdBut Tom thought of\\nsomething, and says:\\n\\n\"You got any spiders in here, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain\\'t, Mars Tom.\"\\n\\n\"All right, we\\'ll get you some.\"\\n\\n\"But bless you, honey, I doan\\' _want_ none. \\ufffdI\\'s afeard un um. \\ufffdI jis\\'\\n\\'s soon have rattlesnakes aroun\\'.\"\\n\\nTom thought a minute or two, and says:\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good idea. \\ufffdAnd I reckon it\\'s been done. \\ufffdIt _must_ a been done;\\nit stands to reason. \\ufffdYes, it\\'s a prime good idea. \\ufffdWhere could you keep\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"Keep what, Mars Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Why, a rattlesnake.\"\\n\\n\"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! \\ufffdWhy, if dey was a rattlesnake to\\ncome in heah I\\'d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid\\nmy head.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Jim, you wouldn\\'t be afraid of it after a little. \\ufffdYou could tame\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"_Tame_ it!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--easy enough. \\ufffdEvery animal is grateful for kindness and petting,\\nand they wouldn\\'t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them. \\ufffdAny book\\nwill tell you that. \\ufffdYou try--that\\'s all I ask; just try for two or three\\ndays. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he\\'ll love you;\\nand sleep with you; and won\\'t stay away from you a minute; and will let\\nyou wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.\"\\n\\n\"_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_\\' talk so! \\ufffdI can\\'t _stan_\\' it! \\ufffdHe\\'d _let_\\nme shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain\\'t it? \\ufffdI lay he\\'d wait a\\npow\\'ful long time \\'fo\\' I _ast_ him. \\ufffdEn mo\\' en dat, I doan\\' _want_ him\\nto sleep wid me.\"\\n\\n\"Jim, don\\'t act so foolish. \\ufffdA prisoner\\'s _got_ to have some kind of a\\ndumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain\\'t ever been tried, why, there\\'s more\\nglory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other\\nway you could ever think of to save your life.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I doan\\' _want_ no sich glory. \\ufffdSnake take \\'n bite\\nJim\\'s chin off, den _whah_ is de glory? \\ufffdNo, sah, I doan\\' want no sich\\ndoin\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Blame it, can\\'t you _try_? \\ufffdI only _want_ you to try--you needn\\'t keep\\nit up if it don\\'t work.\"\\n\\n\"But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I\\'s a tryin\\' him.\\nMars Tom, I\\'s willin\\' to tackle mos\\' anything \\'at ain\\'t onreasonable,\\nbut ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I\\'s\\ngwyne to _leave_, dat\\'s _shore_.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you\\'re so bull-headed about it.\\n\\ufffdWe can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on\\ntheir tails, and let on they\\'re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that \\'ll have\\nto do.\"\\n\\n\"I k\\'n stan\\' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame\\' \\'f I couldn\\' get along widout\\num, I tell you dat. \\ufffdI never knowed b\\'fo\\' \\'t was so much bother and\\ntrouble to be a prisoner.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it _always_ is when it\\'s done right. \\ufffdYou got any rats around\\nhere?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, I hain\\'t seed none.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll get you some rats.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I doan\\' _want_ no rats. \\ufffdDey\\'s de dadblamedest creturs\\nto \\'sturb a body, en rustle roun\\' over \\'im, en bite his feet, when he\\'s\\ntryin\\' to sleep, I ever see. \\ufffdNo, sah, gimme g\\'yarter-snakes, \\'f I\\'s\\ngot to have \\'m, but doan\\' gimme no rats; I hain\\' got no use f\\'r um,\\nskasely.\"\\n\\n\"But, Jim, you _got_ to have \\'em--they all do. \\ufffdSo don\\'t make no more\\nfuss about it. \\ufffdPrisoners ain\\'t ever without rats. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t no\\ninstance of it. \\ufffdAnd they train them, and pet them, and learn them\\ntricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. \\ufffdBut you got to play\\nmusic to them. \\ufffdYou got anything to play music on?\"\\n\\n\"I ain\\' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o\\' paper, en a juice-harp;\\nbut I reck\\'n dey wouldn\\' take no stock in a juice-harp.\"\\n\\n\"Yes they would\\ufffd_they_ don\\'t care what kind of music \\'tis. \\ufffdA\\njews-harp\\'s plenty good enough for a rat. \\ufffdAll animals like music--in a\\nprison they dote on it. \\ufffdSpecially, painful music; and you can\\'t get no\\nother kind out of a jews-harp. \\ufffdIt always interests them; they come out\\nto see what\\'s the matter with you. \\ufffdYes, you\\'re all right; you\\'re fixed\\nvery well. \\ufffdYou want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,\\nand early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play \\'The Last Link\\nis Broken\\'--that\\'s the thing that \\'ll scoop a rat quicker \\'n anything\\nelse; and when you\\'ve played about two minutes you\\'ll see all the rats,\\nand the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,\\nand come. \\ufffdAnd they\\'ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, _dey_ will, I reck\\'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_\\nhavin\\'? Blest if I kin see de pint. \\ufffdBut I\\'ll do it ef I got to. \\ufffdI\\nreck\\'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn\\'t nothing else; and\\npretty soon he says:\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s one thing I forgot. \\ufffdCould you raise a flower here, do you\\nreckon?\"\\n\\n\"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it\\'s tolable dark in heah,\\nen I ain\\' got no use f\\'r no flower, nohow, en she\\'d be a pow\\'ful sight\\no\\' trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you try it, anyway. \\ufffdSome other prisoners has done it.\"\\n\\n\"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin\\' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars\\nTom, I reck\\'n, but she wouldn\\'t be wuth half de trouble she\\'d coss.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you believe it. \\ufffdWe\\'ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in\\nthe corner over there, and raise it. \\ufffdAnd don\\'t call it mullen, call it\\nPitchiola--that\\'s its right name when it\\'s in a prison. \\ufffdAnd you want to\\nwater it with your tears.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.\\n\\ufffdIt\\'s the way they always do.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid\\nspring water whiles another man\\'s a _start\\'n_ one wid tears.\"\\n\\n\"That ain\\'t the idea. \\ufffdYou _got_ to do it with tears.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'ll die on my han\\'s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan\\' skasely\\never cry.\"\\n\\nSo Tom was stumped. \\ufffdBut he studied it over, and then said Jim would\\nhave to worry along the best he could with an onion. \\ufffdHe promised\\nhe would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim\\'s\\ncoffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would \"jis\\' \\'s soon have\\ntobacker in his coffee;\" and found so much fault with it, and with the\\nwork and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and\\npetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of\\nall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,\\nand things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to\\nbe a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all\\npatience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier\\nchances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for\\nhimself, and yet he didn\\'t know enough to appreciate them, and they was\\njust about wasted on him. \\ufffdSo Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn\\'t\\nbehave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\nIN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and\\nfetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour\\nwe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put\\nit in a safe place under Aunt Sally\\'s bed. \\ufffdBut while we was gone for\\nspiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found\\nit there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,\\nand they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was\\na-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what\\nthey could to keep off the dull times for her. \\ufffdSo she took and dusted\\nus both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching\\nanother fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn\\'t\\nthe likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.\\n\\ufffdI never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\\n\\nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\\ncaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet\\'s\\nnest, but we didn\\'t. \\ufffdThe family was at home. \\ufffdWe didn\\'t give it right\\nup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we\\'d\\ntire them out or they\\'d got to tire us out, and they done it. \\ufffdThen we\\ngot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right\\nagain, but couldn\\'t set down convenient. \\ufffdAnd so we went for the snakes,\\nand grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in\\na bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and\\na rattling good honest day\\'s work: \\ufffdand hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!\\n\\ufffdAnd there warn\\'t a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn\\'t\\nhalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. \\ufffdBut it didn\\'t\\nmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. \\ufffdSo\\nwe judged we could get some of them again. \\ufffdNo, there warn\\'t no real\\nscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. \\ufffdYou\\'d see\\nthem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they\\ngenerly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most\\nof the time where you didn\\'t want them. \\ufffdWell, they was handsome and\\nstriped, and there warn\\'t no harm in a million of them; but that never\\nmade no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what\\nthey might, and she couldn\\'t stand them no way you could fix it; and\\nevery time one of them flopped down on her, it didn\\'t make no difference\\nwhat she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. \\ufffdI\\nnever see such a woman. \\ufffdAnd you could hear her whoop to Jericho. \\ufffdYou\\ncouldn\\'t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. \\ufffdAnd if\\nshe turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a\\nhowl that you would think the house was afire. \\ufffdShe disturbed the old\\nman so that he said he could most wish there hadn\\'t ever been no snakes\\ncreated. \\ufffdWhy, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the\\nhouse for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn\\'t over it yet; she warn\\'t\\nnear over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\\ntouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump\\nright out of her stockings. \\ufffdIt was very curious. \\ufffdBut Tom said all\\nwomen was just so. \\ufffdHe said they was made that way for some reason or\\nother.\\n\\nWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\\nallowed these lickings warn\\'t nothing to what she would do if we ever\\nloaded up the place again with them. \\ufffdI didn\\'t mind the lickings,\\nbecause they didn\\'t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\\nhad to lay in another lot. \\ufffdBut we got them laid in, and all the other\\nthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim\\'s was when they\\'d\\nall swarm out for music and go for him. \\ufffdJim didn\\'t like the spiders,\\nand the spiders didn\\'t like Jim; and so they\\'d lay for him, and make it\\nmighty warm for him. \\ufffdAnd he said that between the rats and the snakes\\nand the grindstone there warn\\'t no room in bed for him, skasely; and\\nwhen there was, a body couldn\\'t sleep, it was so lively, and it was\\nalways lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\\ntook turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\\nwhen the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\\ngang under him, in his way, and t\\'other gang having a circus over him,\\nand if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at\\nhim as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn\\'t\\never be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\\n\\nWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\\n\\ufffdThe shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he\\nwould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;\\nthe pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\\ngrindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,\\nand it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. \\ufffdWe reckoned we was all\\ngoing to die, but didn\\'t. \\ufffdIt was the most undigestible sawdust I ever\\nsee; and Tom said the same.\\n\\nBut as I was saying, we\\'d got all the work done now, at last; and we was\\nall pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. \\ufffdThe old man had wrote\\na couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\\nrunaway nigger, but hadn\\'t got no answer, because there warn\\'t no such\\nplantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and\\nNew Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\\nthe cold shivers, and I see we hadn\\'t no time to lose. So Tom said, now\\nfor the nonnamous letters.\\n\\n\"What\\'s them?\" \\ufffdI says.\\n\\n\"Warnings to the people that something is up. \\ufffdSometimes it\\'s done one\\nway, sometimes another. \\ufffdBut there\\'s always somebody spying around that\\ngives notice to the governor of the castle. \\ufffdWhen Louis XVI. was going\\nto light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. \\ufffdIt\\'s a very good\\nway, and so is the nonnamous letters. \\ufffdWe\\'ll use them both. \\ufffdAnd it\\'s\\nusual for the prisoner\\'s mother to change clothes with him, and she\\nstays in, and he slides out in her clothes. \\ufffdWe\\'ll do that, too.\"\\n\\n\"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\\nsomething\\'s up? \\ufffdLet them find it out for themselves--it\\'s their\\nlookout.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know; but you can\\'t depend on them. \\ufffdIt\\'s the way they\\'ve acted\\nfrom the very start--left us to do _everything_. \\ufffdThey\\'re so confiding\\nand mullet-headed they don\\'t take notice of nothing at all. \\ufffdSo if we\\ndon\\'t _give_ them notice there won\\'t be nobody nor nothing to interfere\\nwith us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape \\'ll go\\noff perfectly flat; won\\'t amount to nothing--won\\'t be nothing _to_ it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as for me, Tom, that\\'s the way I\\'d like.\"\\n\\n\"Shucks!\" he says, and looked disgusted. \\ufffdSo I says:\\n\\n\"But I ain\\'t going to make no complaint. \\ufffdAny way that suits you suits\\nme. What you going to do about the servant-girl?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be her. \\ufffdYou slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that\\nyaller girl\\'s frock.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Tom, that \\'ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she\\nprob\\'bly hain\\'t got any but that one.\"\\n\\n\"I know; but you don\\'t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\\nnonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.\"\\n\\n\"All right, then, I\\'ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\\nown togs.\"\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?\"\\n\\n\"No, but there won\\'t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\"\\n\\n\"That ain\\'t got nothing to do with it. \\ufffdThe thing for us to do is just\\nto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or\\nnot. Hain\\'t you got no principle at all?\"\\n\\n\"All right, I ain\\'t saying nothing; I\\'m the servant-girl. \\ufffdWho\\'s Jim\\'s\\nmother?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m his mother. \\ufffdI\\'ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, you\\'ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\"\\n\\n\"Not much. \\ufffdI\\'ll stuff Jim\\'s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed\\nto represent his mother in disguise, and Jim \\'ll take the nigger woman\\'s\\ngown off of me and wear it, and we\\'ll all evade together. \\ufffdWhen a\\nprisoner of style escapes it\\'s called an evasion. \\ufffdIt\\'s always called\\nso when a king escapes, f\\'rinstance. \\ufffdAnd the same with a king\\'s son;\\nit don\\'t make no difference whether he\\'s a natural one or an unnatural\\none.\"\\n\\nSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench\\'s\\nfrock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the\\nway Tom told me to. \\ufffdIt said:\\n\\nBeware. \\ufffdTrouble is brewing. \\ufffdKeep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.\\n\\nNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and\\ncrossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on\\nthe back door. \\ufffdI never see a family in such a sweat. \\ufffdThey couldn\\'t a\\nbeen worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them\\nbehind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air. \\ufffdIf\\na door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said \"ouch!\" if anything fell,\\nshe jumped and said \"ouch!\" if you happened to touch her, when she\\nwarn\\'t noticing, she done the same; she couldn\\'t face noway and be\\nsatisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every\\ntime--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying \"ouch,\" and\\nbefore she\\'d got two-thirds around she\\'d whirl back again, and say it\\nagain; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn\\'t set up. \\ufffdSo the\\nthing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work\\nmore satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\\n\\nSo he said, now for the grand bulge! \\ufffdSo the very next morning at the\\nstreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we\\nbetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going\\nto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. \\ufffdTom he went down the\\nlightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\\nand he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. \\ufffdThis letter\\nsaid:\\n\\nDon\\'t betray me, I wish to be your friend. \\ufffdThere is a desprate gang of\\ncutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway\\nnigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will\\nstay in the house and not bother them. \\ufffdI am one of the gang, but have\\ngot religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and\\nwill betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,\\nalong the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the\\nnigger\\'s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn\\nif I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as\\nthey get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his\\nchains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your\\nleasure. \\ufffdDon\\'t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do\\nthey will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish\\nany reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\nWE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went\\nover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a\\nlook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,\\nand found them in such a sweat and worry they didn\\'t know which end they\\nwas standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done\\nsupper, and wouldn\\'t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a\\nword about the new letter, but didn\\'t need to, because we knowed as much\\nabout it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her\\nback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good\\nlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about\\nhalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally\\'s dress that he stole and\\nwas going to start with the lunch, but says:\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the butter?\"\\n\\n\"I laid out a hunk of it,\" I says, \"on a piece of a corn-pone.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain\\'t here.\"\\n\\n\"We can get along without it,\" I says.\\n\\n\"We can get along _with_ it, too,\" he says; \"just you slide down cellar\\nand fetch it. \\ufffdAnd then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come\\nalong. I\\'ll go and stuff the straw into Jim\\'s clothes to represent his\\nmother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as\\nyou get there.\"\\n\\nSo out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as\\na person\\'s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\\ncorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs\\nvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes\\nAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped\\nmy hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:\\n\\n\"You been down cellar?\"\\n\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\n\\n\"What you been doing down there?\"\\n\\n\"Noth\\'n.\"\\n\\n\"_Noth\\'n!_\"\\n\\n\"No\\'m.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know \\'m.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t _know_? \\ufffdDon\\'t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what\\nyou been _doing_ down there.\"\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I\\nhave.\"\\n\\nI reckoned she\\'d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I\\ns\\'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat\\nabout every little thing that warn\\'t yard-stick straight; so she says,\\nvery decided:\\n\\n\"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. \\ufffdYou\\nbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I\\'ll find out what it\\nis before I\\'M done with you.\"\\n\\nSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.\\nMy, but there was a crowd there! \\ufffdFifteen farmers, and every one of them\\nhad a gun. \\ufffdI was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.\\nThey was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,\\nand all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn\\'t;\\nbut I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,\\nand putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their\\nseats, and fumbling with their buttons. \\ufffdI warn\\'t easy myself, but I\\ndidn\\'t take my hat off, all the same.\\n\\nI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if\\nshe wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we\\'d overdone this\\nthing, and what a thundering hornet\\'s-nest we\\'d got ourselves into, so\\nwe could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before\\nthese rips got out of patience and come for us.\\n\\nAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn\\'t_ answer\\nthem straight, I didn\\'t know which end of me was up; because these men\\nwas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and\\nlay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn\\'t but a few minutes to\\nmidnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the\\nsheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and\\nme a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was\\nthat scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter\\nbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty\\nsoon, when one of them says, \"I\\'M for going and getting in the cabin\\n_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,\" I most\\ndropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and\\nAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:\\n\\n\"For the land\\'s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child? \\ufffdHe\\'s got the\\nbrain-fever as shore as you\\'re born, and they\\'re oozing out!\"\\n\\nAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes\\nthe bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and\\nhugged me, and says:\\n\\n\"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it\\nain\\'t no worse; for luck\\'s against us, and it never rains but it pours,\\nand when I see that truck I thought we\\'d lost you, for I knowed by\\nthe color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,\\ndear, whyd\\'nt you _tell_ me that was what you\\'d been down there for, I\\nwouldn\\'t a cared. \\ufffdNow cler out to bed, and don\\'t lemme see no more of\\nyou till morning!\"\\n\\nI was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,\\nand shinning through the dark for the lean-to. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t hardly get my\\nwords out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must\\njump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,\\nwith guns!\\n\\nHis eyes just blazed; and he says:\\n\\n\"No!--is that so? \\ufffd_ain\\'t_ it bully! \\ufffdWhy, Huck, if it was to do over\\nagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred! \\ufffdIf we could put it off till--\"\\n\\n\"Hurry! \\ufffd_Hurry_!\" \\ufffdI says. \\ufffd\"Where\\'s Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\\n\\ufffdHe\\'s dressed, and everything\\'s ready. \\ufffdNow we\\'ll slide out and give the\\nsheep-signal.\"\\n\\nBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\\nbegin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\\n\\n\"I _told_ you we\\'d be too soon; they haven\\'t come--the door is locked.\\nHere, I\\'ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for \\'em in the\\ndark and kill \\'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,\\nand listen if you can hear \\'em coming.\"\\n\\nSo in they come, but couldn\\'t see us in the dark, and most trod on\\nus whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. \\ufffdBut we got under all\\nright, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\\nand Tom last, which was according to Tom\\'s orders. \\ufffdNow we was in the\\nlean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. \\ufffdSo we crept to the door,\\nand Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn\\'t make\\nout nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\\nfor the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\\nfirst, and him last. \\ufffdSo he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\\nlistened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\\nthe time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\\nnot breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\\ntowards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\\nover it; but Tom\\'s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\\nrail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\\nsnapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\\nand started somebody sings out:\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that? \\ufffdAnswer, or I\\'ll shoot!\"\\n\\nBut we didn\\'t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. \\ufffdThen there\\nwas a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed\\naround us! We heard them sing out:\\n\\n\"Here they are! \\ufffdThey\\'ve broke for the river! \\ufffdAfter \\'em, boys, and turn\\nloose the dogs!\"\\n\\nSo here they come, full tilt. \\ufffdWe could hear them because they wore\\nboots and yelled, but we didn\\'t wear no boots and didn\\'t yell. \\ufffdWe was\\nin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we\\ndodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\\nthem. \\ufffdThey\\'d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn\\'t scare off the\\nrobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\\ncome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\\nstopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn\\'t\\nnobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said\\nhowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and\\nthen we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly\\nto the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was\\ntied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\\nriver, but didn\\'t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we\\nstruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and\\nwe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the\\nbank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. \\ufffdAnd when\\nwe stepped on to the raft I says:\\n\\n\"_Now_, old Jim, you\\'re a free man again, and I bet you won\\'t ever be a\\nslave no more.\"\\n\\n\"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. \\ufffdIt \\'uz planned beautiful, en\\nit \\'uz done beautiful; en dey ain\\'t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat\\'s mo\\'\\nmixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.\"\\n\\nWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because\\nhe had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\\n\\nWhen me and Jim heard that we didn\\'t feel so brash as what we did\\nbefore. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in\\nthe wigwam and tore up one of the duke\\'s shirts for to bandage him, but\\nhe says:\\n\\n\"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. \\ufffdDon\\'t stop now; don\\'t fool around\\nhere, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set\\nher loose! \\ufffdBoys, we done it elegant!--\\'deed we did. \\ufffdI wish _we\\'d_ a\\nhad the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn\\'t a been no \\'Son of Saint\\nLouis, ascend to heaven!\\' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we\\'d\\na whooped him over the _border_--that\\'s what we\\'d a done with _him_--and\\ndone it just as slick as nothing at all, too. \\ufffdMan the sweeps--man the\\nsweeps!\"\\n\\nBut me and Jim was consulting--and thinking. \\ufffdAnd after we\\'d thought a\\nminute, I says:\\n\\n\"Say it, Jim.\"\\n\\nSo he says:\\n\\n\"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. \\ufffdEf it wuz _him_ dat \\'uz\\nbein\\' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, \\'Go on\\nen save me, nemmine \\'bout a doctor f\\'r to save dis one?\\' \\ufffdIs dat like\\nMars Tom Sawyer? \\ufffdWould he say dat? \\ufffdYou _bet_ he wouldn\\'t! \\ufffd_well_,\\nden, is _Jim_ gywne to say it? \\ufffdNo, sah--I doan\\' budge a step out\\'n dis\\nplace \\'dout a _doctor_, not if it\\'s forty year!\"\\n\\nI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he\\'d say what he did say--so\\nit was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.\\n\\ufffdHe raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and\\nwouldn\\'t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose\\nhimself; but we wouldn\\'t let him. \\ufffdThen he give us a piece of his mind,\\nbut it didn\\'t do no good.\\n\\nSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\\n\\n\"Well, then, if you\\'re bound to go, I\\'ll tell you the way to do when you\\nget to the village. \\ufffdShut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and\\nfast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse\\nfull of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the\\nback alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the\\ncanoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take\\nhis chalk away from him, and don\\'t give it back to him till you get him\\nback to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it\\nagain. It\\'s the way they all do.\"\\n\\nSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he\\nsee the doctor coming till he was gone again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\nTHE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\\nhim up. \\ufffdI told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting\\nyesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about\\nmidnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and\\nshot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and\\nnot say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to\\ncome home this evening and surprise the folks.\\n\\n\"Who is your folks?\" he says.\\n\\n\"The Phelpses, down yonder.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he says. \\ufffdAnd after a minute, he says:\\n\\n\"How\\'d you say he got shot?\"\\n\\n\"He had a dream,\" I says, \"and it shot him.\"\\n\\n\"Singular dream,\" he says.\\n\\nSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. \\ufffdBut\\nwhen he sees the canoe he didn\\'t like the look of her--said she was big\\nenough for one, but didn\\'t look pretty safe for two. \\ufffdI says:\\n\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"What three?\"\\n\\n\"Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that\\'s what I mean.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he says.\\n\\nBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\\nand said he reckoned he\\'d look around for a bigger one. \\ufffdBut they was\\nall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\\ntill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\\ngo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. \\ufffdBut\\nI said I didn\\'t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\\nstarted.\\n\\nI struck an idea pretty soon. \\ufffdI says to myself, spos\\'n he can\\'t fix\\nthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep\\'s tail, as the saying is?\\nspos\\'n it takes him three or four days? \\ufffdWhat are we going to do?--lay\\naround there till he lets the cat out of the bag? \\ufffdNo, sir; I know what\\n_I\\'ll_ do. \\ufffdI\\'ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he\\'s got to\\ngo any more I\\'ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we\\'ll take and tie\\nhim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom\\'s done\\nwith him we\\'ll give him what it\\'s worth, or all we got, and then let him\\nget ashore.\\n\\nSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\\nwaked up the sun was away up over my head! \\ufffdI shot out and went for the\\ndoctor\\'s house, but they told me he\\'d gone away in the night some time\\nor other, and warn\\'t back yet. \\ufffdWell, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\\nfor Tom, and I\\'ll dig out for the island right off. \\ufffdSo away I shoved,\\nand turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas\\'s\\nstomach! He says:\\n\\n\"Why, _Tom!_ \\ufffdWhere you been all this time, you rascal?\"\\n\\n\"I hain\\'t been nowheres,\" I says, \"only just hunting for the runaway\\nnigger--me and Sid.\"\\n\\n\"Why, where ever did you go?\" he says. \\ufffd\"Your aunt\\'s been mighty\\nuneasy.\"\\n\\n\"She needn\\'t,\" I says, \"because we was all right. \\ufffdWe followed the men\\nand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we\\nheard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and\\ncrossed over, but couldn\\'t find nothing of them; so we cruised along\\nup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\\nand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\\npaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid\\'s at the post-office to see\\nwhat he can hear, and I\\'m a-branching out to get something to eat for\\nus, and then we\\'re going home.\"\\n\\nSo then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I\\nsuspicioned, he warn\\'t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the\\noffice, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn\\'t come; so the old man\\nsaid, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done\\nfooling around--but we would ride. \\ufffdI couldn\\'t get him to let me stay\\nand wait for Sid; and he said there warn\\'t no use in it, and I must come\\nalong, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\\n\\nWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and\\ncried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that\\ndon\\'t amount to shucks, and said she\\'d serve Sid the same when he come.\\n\\nAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers\\' wives, to dinner;\\nand such another clack a body never heard. \\ufffdOld Mrs. Hotchkiss was the\\nworst; her tongue was a-going all the time. \\ufffdShe says:\\n\\n\"Well, Sister Phelps, I\\'ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an\\' I b\\'lieve\\nthe nigger was crazy. \\ufffdI says to Sister Damrell--didn\\'t I, Sister\\nDamrell?--s\\'I, he\\'s crazy, s\\'I--them\\'s the very words I said. \\ufffdYou all\\nhearn me: he\\'s crazy, s\\'I; everything shows it, s\\'I. \\ufffdLook at that-air\\ngrindstone, s\\'I; want to tell _me_\\'t any cretur \\'t\\'s in his right mind\\n\\'s a goin\\' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s\\'I?\\n\\ufffdHere sich \\'n\\' sich a person busted his heart; \\'n\\' here so \\'n\\' so\\npegged along for thirty-seven year, \\'n\\' all that--natcherl son o\\' Louis\\nsomebody, \\'n\\' sich everlast\\'n rubbage. \\ufffdHe\\'s plumb crazy, s\\'I; it\\'s what\\nI says in the fust place, it\\'s what I says in the middle, \\'n\\' it\\'s what\\nI says last \\'n\\' all the time--the nigger\\'s crazy--crazy \\'s Nebokoodneezer,\\ns\\'I.\"\\n\\n\"An\\' look at that-air ladder made out\\'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,\" says\\nold Mrs. Damrell; \"what in the name o\\' goodness _could_ he ever want\\nof--\"\\n\\n\"The very words I was a-sayin\\' no longer ago th\\'n this minute to Sister\\nUtterback, \\'n\\' she\\'ll tell you so herself. \\ufffdSh-she, look at that-air rag\\nladder, sh-she; \\'n\\' s\\'I, yes, _look_ at it, s\\'I--what _could_ he a-wanted\\nof it, s\\'I. \\ufffdSh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--\"\\n\\n\"But how in the nation\\'d they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,\\n_anyway_? \\'n\\' who dug that-air _hole_? \\'n\\' who--\"\\n\\n\"My very _words_, Brer Penrod! \\ufffdI was a-sayin\\'--pass that-air sasser o\\'\\nm\\'lasses, won\\'t ye?--I was a-sayin\\' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,\\nhow _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s\\'I. \\ufffdWithout _help_, mind\\nyou--\\'thout _help_! \\ufffd_that\\'s_ wher \\'tis. \\ufffdDon\\'t tell _me_, s\\'I; there\\n_wuz_ help, s\\'I; \\'n\\' ther\\' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s\\'I; ther\\'s ben a\\n_dozen_ a-helpin\\' that nigger, \\'n\\' I lay I\\'d skin every last nigger on\\nthis place but _I\\'d_ find out who done it, s\\'I; \\'n\\' moreover, s\\'I--\"\\n\\n\"A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn\\'t a done every thing that\\'s been\\ndone.

Think o\\' what, Brer Phelps, s\\'I? \\ufffdThink o\\' that bed-leg\\nsawed off that a way, s\\'e? \\ufffd_think_ of it, s\\'I? \\ufffdI lay it never sawed\\n_itself_ off, s\\'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s\\'I; that\\'s my opinion, take it\\nor leave it, it mayn\\'t be no \\'count, s\\'I, but sich as \\'t is, it\\'s my\\nopinion, s\\'I, \\'n\\' if any body k\\'n start a better one, s\\'I, let him _do_\\nit, s\\'I, that\\'s all. \\ufffdI says to Sister Dunlap, s\\'I--\"\\n\\n\"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o\\' niggers in there\\nevery night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. \\ufffdLook\\nat that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African\\nwrit\\'n done with blood! \\ufffdMust a ben a raft uv \\'m at it right along, all\\nthe time, amost. \\ufffdWhy, I\\'d give two dollars to have it read to me; \\'n\\'\\nas for the niggers that wrote it, I \\'low I\\'d take \\'n\\' lash \\'m t\\'ll--\"\\n\\n\"People to _help_ him, Brother Marples! \\ufffdWell, I reckon you\\'d _think_\\nso if you\\'d a been in this house for a while back. \\ufffdWhy, they\\'ve stole\\neverything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,\\nmind you.

Why, _sperits_ couldn\\'t a done better and\\nbeen no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_\\nknow our dogs, and ther\\' ain\\'t no better; well, them dogs never even got\\non the _track_ of \\'m once! \\ufffdYou explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_\\nof you!\"\\n\\n\"Well, it does beat--\"\\n\\n\"Laws alive, I never--\"\\n\\n\"So help me, I wouldn\\'t a be--\"\\n\\n\"_House_-thieves as well as--\"\\n\\n\"Goodnessgracioussakes, I\\'d a ben afeard to live in sich a--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn\\'t hardly go to bed, or\\nget up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway. \\ufffdWhy, they\\'d steal\\nthe very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was\\nin by the time midnight come last night. \\ufffdI hope to gracious if I warn\\'t\\nafraid they\\'d steal some o\\' the family! \\ufffdI was just to that pass I\\ndidn\\'t have no reasoning faculties no more. \\ufffdIt looks foolish enough\\n_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there\\'s my two poor boys\\nasleep, \\'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness\\nI was that uneasy \\'t I crep\\' up there and locked \\'em in! \\ufffdI _did_. \\ufffdAnd\\nanybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it\\nkeeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your\\nwits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o\\' wild things,\\nand by and by you think to yourself, spos\\'n I was a boy, and was away up\\nthere, and the door ain\\'t locked, and you--\" She stopped, looking kind\\nof wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye\\nlit on me--I got up and took a walk.\\n\\nSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that\\nroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.\\n\\ufffdSo I done it. \\ufffdBut I dasn\\'t go fur, or she\\'d a sent for me. \\ufffdAnd when\\nit was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and\\ntold her the noise and shooting waked up me and \"Sid,\" and the door was\\nlocked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,\\nand both of us got hurt a little, and we didn\\'t never want to try _that_\\nno more. \\ufffdAnd then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas\\nbefore; and then she said she\\'d forgive us, and maybe it was all right\\nenough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys\\nwas a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long\\nas no harm hadn\\'t come of it, she judged she better put in her time\\nbeing grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of\\nfretting over what was past and done. \\ufffdSo then she kissed me, and patted\\nme on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty\\nsoon jumps up, and says:\\n\\n\"Why, lawsamercy, it\\'s most night, and Sid not come yet! \\ufffdWhat _has_\\nbecome of that boy?\"\\n\\nI see my chance; so I skips up and says:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll run right up to town and get him,\" I says.\\n\\n\"No you won\\'t,\" she says. \\ufffd\"You\\'ll stay right wher\\' you are; _one\\'s_\\nenough to be lost at a time. \\ufffdIf he ain\\'t here to supper, your uncle \\'ll\\ngo.\"\\n\\nWell, he warn\\'t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\\n\\nHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn\\'t run across Tom\\'s\\ntrack. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said\\nthere warn\\'t no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you\\'ll\\nsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. \\ufffdSo she had\\nto be satisfied. \\ufffdBut she said she\\'d set up for him a while anyway, and\\nkeep a light burning so he could see it.\\n\\nAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her\\ncandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like\\nI couldn\\'t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked\\nwith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn\\'t\\nseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every\\nnow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe\\ndrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or\\ndead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down\\nsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home\\nin the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,\\nand tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her\\ngood, and she was in so much trouble. \\ufffdAnd when she was going away she\\nlooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:\\n\\n\"The door ain\\'t going to be locked, Tom, and there\\'s the window and\\nthe rod; but you\\'ll be good, _won\\'t_ you? \\ufffdAnd you won\\'t go? \\ufffdFor _my_\\nsake.\"\\n\\nLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all\\nintending to go; but after that I wouldn\\'t a went, not for kingdoms.\\n\\nBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.\\nAnd twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around\\nfront, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her\\neyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do\\nsomething for her, but I couldn\\'t, only to swear that I wouldn\\'t never\\ndo nothing to grieve her any more. \\ufffdAnd the third time I waked up at\\ndawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,\\nand her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\nTHE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn\\'t get no\\ntrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying\\nnothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not\\neating anything. And by and by the old man says:\\n\\n\"Did I give you the letter?\"\\n\\n\"What letter?\"\\n\\n\"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\"\\n\\n\"No, you didn\\'t give me no letter.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I must a forgot it.\"\\n\\nSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had\\nlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. \\ufffdShe says:\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s from St. Petersburg--it\\'s from Sis.\"\\n\\nI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn\\'t stir. \\ufffdBut\\nbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see\\nsomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\\ndoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;\\nand a lot of people. \\ufffdI hid the letter behind the first thing that come\\nhandy, and rushed. \\ufffdShe flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s dead, he\\'s dead, I know he\\'s dead!\"\\n\\nAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\\nwhich showed he warn\\'t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,\\nand says:\\n\\n\"He\\'s alive, thank God! \\ufffdAnd that\\'s enough!\" and she snatched a kiss of\\nhim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders\\nright and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue\\ncould go, every jump of the way.\\n\\nI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the\\nold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. \\ufffdThe men\\nwas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to\\nall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn\\'t be trying to run\\naway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\\nwhole family scared most to death for days and nights. \\ufffdBut the others\\nsaid, don\\'t do it, it wouldn\\'t answer at all; he ain\\'t our nigger, and\\nhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. \\ufffdSo that cooled\\nthem down a little, because the people that\\'s always the most anxious\\nfor to hang a nigger that hain\\'t done just right is always the very\\nones that ain\\'t the most anxious to pay for him when they\\'ve got their\\nsatisfaction out of him.\\n\\nThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the\\nhead once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to\\nknow me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes\\non him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to\\na big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and\\nboth legs, and said he warn\\'t to have nothing but bread and water to\\neat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because\\nhe didn\\'t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and\\nsaid a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the\\ncabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and\\nabout this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with\\na kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and\\ntakes a look, and says:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be no rougher on him than you\\'re obleeged to, because he ain\\'t\\na bad nigger. \\ufffdWhen I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn\\'t cut\\nthe bullet out without some help, and he warn\\'t in no condition for\\nme to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little\\nworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn\\'t let\\nme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he\\'d kill\\nme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn\\'t do\\nanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and\\nthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says\\nhe\\'ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. \\ufffdOf course I\\njudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had\\nto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. \\ufffdIt\\nwas a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and\\nof course I\\'d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn\\'t,\\nbecause the nigger might get away, and then I\\'d be to blame; and yet\\nnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail. \\ufffdSo there I had to stick\\nplumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a\\nbetter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,\\nand was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he\\'d been worked\\nmain hard lately. \\ufffdI liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a\\nnigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. \\ufffdI\\nhad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he\\nwould a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I\\n_was_, with both of \\'m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about\\ndawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck\\nwould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped\\non his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped\\nup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was\\nabout, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a\\nflighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and\\ntowed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least\\nrow nor said a word from the start. \\ufffdHe ain\\'t no bad nigger, gentlemen;\\nthat\\'s what I think about him.\"\\n\\nSomebody says:\\n\\n\"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I\\'m obleeged to say.\"\\n\\nThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\\nto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\\naccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\\nheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. \\ufffdThen they\\nall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some\\nnotice took of it, and reward. \\ufffdSo every one of them promised, right out\\nand hearty, that they wouldn\\'t cuss him no more.\\n\\nThen they come out and locked him up. \\ufffdI hoped they was going to say he\\ncould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\\nheavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\\ndidn\\'t think of it, and I reckoned it warn\\'t best for me to mix in, but\\nI judged I\\'d get the doctor\\'s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as\\nsoon as I\\'d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of\\nme--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot\\nwhen I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling\\naround hunting the runaway nigger.\\n\\nBut I had plenty time. \\ufffdAunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\\nand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged\\nhim.\\n\\nNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\\nSally was gone to get a nap. \\ufffdSo I slips to the sick-room, and if I\\nfound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\\nwould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\\npale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. \\ufffdSo I set down and\\nlaid for him to wake. \\ufffdIn about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\\nin, and there I was, up a stump again! \\ufffdShe motioned me to be still, and\\nset down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\\nnow, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he\\'d been sleeping\\nlike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the\\ntime, and ten to one he\\'d wake up in his right mind.\\n\\nSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\\neyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\\n\\n\"Hello!--why, I\\'m at _home_! \\ufffdHow\\'s that? \\ufffdWhere\\'s the raft?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" I says.\\n\\n\"And _Jim_?\"\\n\\n\"The same,\" I says, but couldn\\'t say it pretty brash. \\ufffdBut he never\\nnoticed, but says:\\n\\n\"Good! \\ufffdSplendid! \\ufffd_Now_ we\\'re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\"\\n\\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: \\ufffd\"About what, Sid?\"\\n\\n\"Why, about the way the whole thing was done.\"\\n\\n\"What whole thing?\"\\n\\n\"Why, _the_ whole thing. \\ufffdThere ain\\'t but one; how we set the runaway\\nnigger free--me and Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Good land! \\ufffdSet the run--What _is_ the child talking about! \\ufffdDear, dear,\\nout of his head again!\"\\n\\n\"_No_, I ain\\'t out of my _head_; I know all what I\\'m talking about. \\ufffdWe\\n_did_ set him free--me and Tom. \\ufffdWe laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.\\n\\ufffdAnd we done it elegant, too.\" \\ufffdHe\\'d got a start, and she never checked\\nhim up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and\\nI see it warn\\'t no use for _me_ to put in. \\ufffd\"Why, Aunty, it cost us a\\npower of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was\\nall asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,\\nand your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the\\nwarming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,\\nand you can\\'t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and\\ninscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can\\'t think _half_ the\\nfun it was. \\ufffdAnd we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,\\nand nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the\\nlightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder\\nand send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work\\nwith in your apron pocket--\"\\n\\n\"Mercy sakes!\"\\n\\n\"--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for\\nJim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that\\nyou come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before\\nwe was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let\\ndrive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let\\nthem go by, and when the dogs come they warn\\'t interested in us, but\\nwent for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the\\nraft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by\\nourselves, and _wasn\\'t_ it bully, Aunty!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! \\ufffdSo it was\\n_you_, you little rapscallions, that\\'s been making all this trouble,\\nand turned everybody\\'s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to\\ndeath. \\ufffdI\\'ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out\\no\\' you this very minute. \\ufffdTo think, here I\\'ve been, night after night,\\na--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I\\'ll tan the Old\\nHarry out o\\' both o\\' ye!\"\\n\\nBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn\\'t_ hold in,\\nand his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all\\nalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she\\nsays:\\n\\n\"_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I\\ntell you if I catch you meddling with him again--\"\\n\\n\"Meddling with _who_?\" \\ufffdTom says, dropping his smile and looking\\nsurprised.\\n\\n\"With _who_? \\ufffdWhy, the runaway nigger, of course. \\ufffdWho\\'d you reckon?\"\\n\\nTom looks at me very grave, and says:\\n\\n\"Tom, didn\\'t you just tell me he was all right? \\ufffdHasn\\'t he got away?\"\\n\\n\"_Him_?\" says Aunt Sally; \"the runaway nigger? \\ufffd\\'Deed he hasn\\'t.\\n\\ufffdThey\\'ve got him back, safe and sound, and he\\'s in that cabin again,\\non bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he\\'s claimed or\\nsold!\"\\n\\nTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening\\nand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:\\n\\n\"They hain\\'t no _right_ to shut him up! \\ufffdSHOVE!--and don\\'t you lose a\\nminute. \\ufffdTurn him loose! he ain\\'t no slave; he\\'s as free as any cretur\\nthat walks this earth!\"\\n\\n\"What _does_ the child mean?\"\\n\\n\"I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don\\'t go, _I\\'ll_\\ngo. I\\'ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. \\ufffdOld Miss\\nWatson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to\\nsell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her\\nwill.\"\\n\\n\"Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was\\nalready free?\"\\n\\n\"Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women! \\ufffdWhy,\\nI wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I\\'d a waded neck-deep in blood\\nto--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_\"\\n\\nIf she warn\\'t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\\nsweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\\n\\nAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and\\ncried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,\\nfor it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. \\ufffdAnd I peeped\\nout, and in a little while Tom\\'s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and\\nstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding\\nhim into the earth, you know. \\ufffdAnd then she says:\\n\\n\"Yes, you _better_ turn y\\'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, deary me!\" says Aunt Sally; \"_Is_ he changed so? \\ufffdWhy, that ain\\'t\\n_Tom_, it\\'s Sid; Tom\\'s--Tom\\'s--why, where is Tom? \\ufffdHe was here a minute\\nago.\"\\n\\n\"You mean where\\'s Huck _Finn_--that\\'s what you mean! \\ufffdI reckon I hain\\'t\\nraised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I\\n_see_ him. \\ufffdThat _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that\\nbed, Huck Finn.\"\\n\\nSo I done it. \\ufffdBut not feeling brash.\\n\\nAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever\\nsee--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told\\nit all to him. \\ufffdIt kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn\\'t\\nknow nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting\\nsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the\\noldest man in the world couldn\\'t a understood it. \\ufffdSo Tom\\'s Aunt Polly,\\nshe told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how\\nI was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom\\nSawyer--she chipped in and says, \"Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I\\'m\\nused to it now, and \\'tain\\'t no need to change\"--that when Aunt Sally took\\nme for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn\\'t no other way, and\\nI knowed he wouldn\\'t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being\\na mystery, and he\\'d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly\\nsatisfied. \\ufffdAnd so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made\\nthings as soft as he could for me.\\n\\nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting\\nJim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took\\nall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn\\'t\\never understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_\\nhelp a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\\n\\nWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and\\n_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\\n\\n\"Look at that, now! \\ufffdI might have expected it, letting him go off that\\nway without anybody to watch him. \\ufffdSo now I got to go and trapse all\\nthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that\\ncreetur\\'s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn\\'t seem to get any\\nanswer out of you about it.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I never heard nothing from you,\" says Aunt Sally.\\n\\n\"Well, I wonder! \\ufffdWhy, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean\\nby Sid being here.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never got \\'em, Sis.\"\\n\\nAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:\\n\\n\"You, Tom!\"\\n\\n\"Well--_what_?\" he says, kind of pettish.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.\"\\n\\n\"What letters?\"\\n\\n\"_Them_ letters. \\ufffdI be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I\\'ll--\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re in the trunk. \\ufffdThere, now. \\ufffdAnd they\\'re just the same as they\\nwas when I got them out of the office. \\ufffdI hain\\'t looked into them, I\\nhain\\'t touched them. \\ufffdBut I knowed they\\'d make trouble, and I thought if\\nyou warn\\'t in no hurry, I\\'d--\"\\n\\n\"Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain\\'t no mistake about it. \\ufffdAnd I\\nwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s\\'pose he--\"\\n\\n\"No, it come yesterday; I hain\\'t read it yet, but _it\\'s_ all right, I\\'ve\\ngot that one.\"\\n\\nI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn\\'t, but I reckoned maybe it\\nwas just as safe to not to. \\ufffdSo I never said nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THE LAST\\n\\nTHE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time\\nof the evasion?--what it was he\\'d planned to do if the evasion worked all\\nright and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?\\nAnd he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got\\nJim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and\\nhave adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about\\nhis being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,\\nand pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all\\nthe niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight\\nprocession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would\\nwe. \\ufffdBut I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.\\n\\nWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle\\nSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,\\nthey made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him\\nall he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. \\ufffdAnd we had\\nhim up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty\\ndollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,\\nand Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:\\n\\n\"Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson\\nislan\\'? \\ufffdI _tole_ you I got a hairy breas\\', en what\\'s de sign un it; en\\nI _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it\\'s\\ncome true; en heah she is! \\ufffd_dah_, now! doan\\' talk to _me_--signs is\\n_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis\\' \\'s well \\'at I \\'uz gwineter be\\nrich agin as I\\'s a-stannin\\' heah dis minute!\"\\n\\nAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le\\'s all three\\nslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for\\nhowling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a\\ncouple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I\\nain\\'t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn\\'t get\\nnone from home, because it\\'s likely pap\\'s been back before now, and got\\nit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.\\n\\n\"No, he hain\\'t,\" Tom says; \"it\\'s all there yet--six thousand dollars\\nand more; and your pap hain\\'t ever been back since. \\ufffdHadn\\'t when I come\\naway, anyhow.\"\\n\\nJim says, kind of solemn:\\n\\n\"He ain\\'t a-comin\\' back no mo\\', Huck.\"\\n\\nI says:\\n\\n\"Why, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain\\'t comin\\' back no mo.\"\\n\\nBut I kept at him; so at last he says:\\n\\n\"Doan\\' you \\'member de house dat was float\\'n down de river, en dey wuz a\\nman in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn\\' let you\\ncome in? \\ufffdWell, den, you kin git yo\\' money when you wants it, kase dat\\nwuz him.\"\\n\\nTom\\'s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard\\nfor a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain\\'t\\nnothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I\\'d\\na knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn\\'t a tackled it,\\nand ain\\'t a-going to no more. \\ufffdBut I reckon I got to light out for the\\nTerritory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she\\'s going to adopt me\\nand sivilize me, and I can\\'t stand it. \\ufffdI been there before.\\n\\nTHE END.

Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her\\nfour tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the\\ncave where they all lived. \"Augrh!\" said Father Wolf. \"It is time to\\nhunt again.\" He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with\\na bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: \"Good luck go with you, O\\nChief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble\\nchildren that they may never forget the hungry in this world.\"\\n\\nIt was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India\\ndespise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling\\ntales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village\\nrubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more\\nthan anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets\\nthat he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting\\neverything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui\\ngoes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake\\na wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the\\nmadness--and run.\\n\\n\"Enter, then, and look,\" said Father Wolf stiffly, \"but there is no food\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"For a wolf, no,\" said Tabaqui, \"but for so mean a person as myself a\\ndry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people],\\nto pick and choose?\" He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he\\nfound the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end\\nmerrily.\\n\\n\"All thanks for this good meal,\" he said, licking his lips. \"How\\nbeautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young\\ntoo! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings\\nare men from the beginning.\"\\n\\nNow, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so\\nunlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see\\nMother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.\\n\\nTabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then\\nhe said spitefully:\\n\\n\"Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt\\namong these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.\"\\n\\nShere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty\\nmiles away.\\n\\n\"He has no right!\" Father Wolf began angrily--\"By the Law of the Jungle\\nhe has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will\\nfrighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for\\ntwo, these days.\"\\n\\n\"His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,\" said\\nMother Wolf quietly. \"He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That\\nis why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are\\nangry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry.\\nThey will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our\\nchildren must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very\\ngrateful to Shere Khan!\"\\n\\n\"Shall I tell him of your gratitude?\" said Tabaqui.\\n\\n\"Out!\" snapped Father Wolf. \"Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast\\ndone harm enough for one night.\"\\n\\n\"I go,\" said Tabaqui quietly. \"Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the\\nthickets. I might have saved myself the message.\"\\n\\nFather Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little\\nriver he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has\\ncaught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.\\n\\n\"The fool!\" said Father Wolf. \"To begin a night\\'s work with that noise!\\nDoes he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?\"\\n\\n\"H\\'sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,\" said Mother\\nWolf. \"It is Man.\"\\n\\nThe whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come\\nfrom every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders\\nwoodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run\\nsometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.\\n\\n\"Man!\" said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. \"Faugh! Are there\\nnot enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on\\nour ground too!\"\\n\\nThe Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,\\nforbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his\\nchildren how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds\\nof his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing\\nmeans, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with\\nguns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.\\nThen everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among\\nthemselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living\\nthings, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is\\ntrue--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.\\n\\nThe purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated \"Aaarh!\" of the\\ntiger\\'s charge.\\n\\nThen there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. \"He has\\nmissed,\" said Mother Wolf. \"What is it?\"\\n\\nFather Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and\\nmumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub.\\n\\n\"The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter\\'s campfire,\\nand has burned his feet,\" said Father Wolf with a grunt. \"Tabaqui is\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"Something is coming uphill,\" said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. \"Get\\nready.\"\\n\\nThe bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped\\nwith his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been\\nwatching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the\\nwolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before he saw what it was\\nhe was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was\\nthat he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing\\nalmost where he left ground.\\n\\n\"Man!\" he snapped. \"A man\\'s cub. Look!\"\\n\\nDirectly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked\\nbrown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom\\nas ever came to a wolf\\'s cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolf\\'s\\nface, and laughed.\\n\\n\"Is that a man\\'s cub?\" said Mother Wolf. \"I have never seen one. Bring\\nit here.\"\\n\\nA Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg\\nwithout breaking it, and though Father Wolf\\'s jaws closed right on the\\nchild\\'s back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down\\namong the cubs.\\n\\n\"How little! How naked, and--how bold!\" said Mother Wolf softly. The\\nbaby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.\\n\"Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man\\'s\\ncub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man\\'s cub among\\nher children?\"\\n\\n\"I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in\\nmy time,\" said Father Wolf. \"He is altogether without hair, and I\\ncould kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not\\nafraid.\"\\n\\nThe moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan\\'s\\ngreat square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui,\\nbehind him, was squeaking: \"My lord, my lord, it went in here!\"\\n\\n\"Shere Khan does us great honor,\" said Father Wolf, but his eyes were\\nvery angry. \"What does Shere Khan need?\"\\n\\n\"My quarry. A man\\'s cub went this way,\" said Shere Khan. \"Its parents\\nhave run off. Give it to me.\"\\n\\nShere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter\\'s campfire, as Father Wolf had\\nsaid, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf\\nknew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in\\nby. Even where he was, Shere Khan\\'s shoulders and forepaws were cramped\\nfor want of room, as a man\\'s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel.\\n\\n\"The Wolves are a free people,\" said Father Wolf. \"They take orders from\\nthe Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man\\'s\\ncub is ours--to kill if we choose.\"\\n\\n\"Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the\\nbull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog\\'s den for my fair\\ndues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!\"\\n\\nThe tiger\\'s roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself\\nclear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in\\nthe darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.\\n\\n\"And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man\\'s cub is mine,\\nLungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with\\nthe Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of\\nlittle naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now get\\nhence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back\\nthou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever\\nthou camest into the world! Go!\"\\n\\nFather Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he\\nwon Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in\\nthe Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment\\'s sake. Shere Khan\\nmight have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother\\nWolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the\\nground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth\\ngrowling, and when he was clear he shouted:\\n\\n\"Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to\\nthis fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will\\ncome in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!\"\\n\\nMother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf\\nsaid to her gravely:\\n\\n\"Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack.\\nWilt thou still keep him, Mother?\"\\n\\n\"Keep him!\" she gasped. \"He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry;\\nyet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side\\nalready. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run\\noff to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our\\nlairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little\\nfrog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will\\ncome when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.\"\\n\\n\"But what will our Pack say?\" said Father Wolf.\\n\\nThe Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he\\nmarries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs\\nare old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack\\nCouncil, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order\\nthat the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs\\nare free to run where they please, and until they have killed their\\nfirst buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one\\nof them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if\\nyou think for a minute you will see that this must be so.\\n\\nFather Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the\\nnight of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the\\nCouncil Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred\\nwolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack\\nby strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and\\nbelow him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from\\nbadger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black\\nthree-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a\\nyear now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he\\nhad been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs\\nof men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over\\neach other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers\\nsat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look\\nat him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a\\nmother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that\\nhe had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: \"Ye know\\nthe Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!\" And the anxious mothers\\nwould take up the call: \"Look--look well, O Wolves!\"\\n\\nAt last--and Mother Wolf\\'s neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father\\nWolf pushed \"Mowgli the Frog,\" as they called him, into the center,\\nwhere he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in\\nthe moonlight.\\n\\nAkela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the\\nmonotonous cry: \"Look well!\" A muffled roar came up from behind the\\nrocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: \"The cub is mine. Give him to\\nme. What have the Free People to do with a man\\'s cub?\" Akela never even\\ntwitched his ears. All he said was: \"Look well, O Wolves! What have\\nthe Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look\\nwell!\"\\n\\nThere was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year\\nflung back Shere Khan\\'s question to Akela: \"What have the Free People to\\ndo with a man\\'s cub?\" Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there\\nis any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he\\nmust be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his\\nfather and mother.\\n\\n\"Who speaks for this cub?\" said Akela. \"Among the Free People who\\nspeaks?\" There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew\\nwould be her last fight, if things came to fighting.\\n\\nThen the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo,\\nthe sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle:\\nold Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only\\nnuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.\\n\\n\"The man\\'s cub--the man\\'s cub?\" he said. \"I speak for the man\\'s cub.\\nThere is no harm in a man\\'s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak\\nthe truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I\\nmyself will teach him.\"\\n\\n\"We need yet another,\" said Akela. \"Baloo has spoken, and he is our\\nteacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?\"\\n\\nA black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black\\nPanther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing\\nup in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew\\nBagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as\\nTabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded\\nelephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree,\\nand a skin softer than down.\\n\\n\"O Akela, and ye the Free People,\" he purred, \"I have no right in your\\nassembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which\\nis not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may\\nbe bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay\\nthat price. Am I right?\"\\n\\n\"Good! Good!\" said the young wolves, who are always hungry. \"Listen to\\nBagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.\"\\n\\n\"Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.\"\\n\\n\"Speak then,\" cried twenty voices.\\n\\n\"To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you\\nwhen he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo\\'s word\\nI will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile\\nfrom here, if ye will accept the man\\'s cub according to the Law. Is it\\ndifficult?\"\\n\\nThere was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: \"What matter? He will\\ndie in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can\\na naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull,\\nBagheera? Let him be accepted.\" And then came Akela\\'s deep bay, crying:\\n\"Look well--look well, O Wolves!\"\\n\\nMowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice\\nwhen the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went\\ndown the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and\\nMowgli\\'s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for\\nhe was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.\\n\\n\"Ay, roar well,\" said Bagheera, under his whiskers, \"for the time will\\ncome when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I\\nknow nothing of man.\"\\n\\n\"It was well done,\" said Akela. \"Men and their cubs are very wise. He\\nmay be a help in time.\"\\n\\n\"Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack\\nforever,\" said Bagheera.\\n\\nAkela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every\\nleader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler\\nand feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader\\ncomes up--to be killed in his turn.\\n\\n\"Take him away,\" he said to Father Wolf, \"and train him as befits one of\\nthe Free People.\"\\n\\nAnd that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the\\nprice of a bull and on Baloo\\'s good word.\\n\\nNow you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only\\nguess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves,\\nbecause if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He\\ngrew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost\\nbefore he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the\\nmeaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every\\nbreath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head,\\nevery scratch of a bat\\'s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and\\nevery splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much\\nto him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was\\nnot learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep\\nagain. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and\\nwhen he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as\\npleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera\\nshowed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, \"Come\\nalong, Little Brother,\" and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth,\\nbut afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as\\nboldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too,\\nwhen the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any\\nwolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare\\nfor fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads\\nof his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their\\ncoats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night,\\nand look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a\\nmistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop\\ngate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it,\\nand told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to\\ngo with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all\\nthrough the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his\\nkilling. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did\\nMowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand\\nthings, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had\\nbeen bought into the Pack at the price of a bull\\'s life. \"All the jungle\\nis thine,\" said Bagheera, \"and thou canst kill everything that thou art\\nstrong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee\\nthou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of\\nthe Jungle.\" Mowgli obeyed faithfully.\\n\\nAnd he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that\\nhe is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of\\nexcept things to eat.\\n\\nMother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature\\nto be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan. But though a\\nyoung wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot\\nit because he was only a boy--though he would have called himself a wolf\\nif he had been able to speak in any human tongue.\\n\\nShere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew\\nolder and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the\\nyounger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela\\nwould never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the\\nproper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such\\nfine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man\\'s\\ncub. \"They tell me,\" Shere Khan would say, \"that at Council ye dare\\nnot look him between the eyes.\" And the young wolves would growl and\\nbristle.\\n\\nBagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and\\nonce or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill\\nhim some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: \"I have the Pack and I have\\nthee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my\\nsake. Why should I be afraid?\"\\n\\nIt was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of\\nsomething that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told him;\\nbut he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy lay\\nwith his head on Bagheera\\'s beautiful black skin, \"Little Brother, how\\noften have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?\"\\n\\n\"As many times as there are nuts on that palm,\" said Mowgli, who,\\nnaturally, could not count. \"What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and\\nShere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.\"\\n\\n\"But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack\\nknow it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\"Ho! ho!\" said Mowgli. \"Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude\\ntalk that I was a naked man\\'s cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts. But I\\ncaught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm-tree to\\nteach him better manners.\"\\n\\n\"That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he would\\nhave told thee of something that concerned thee closely. Open those\\neyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But\\nremember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot kill\\nhis buck, and then he will be leader no more. Many of the wolves that\\nlooked thee over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old\\ntoo, and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that\\na man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou wilt be a\\nman.\"\\n\\n\"And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?\" said\\nMowgli. \"I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle,\\nand there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn.\\nSurely they are my brothers!\"\\n\\nBagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes.\\n\"Little Brother,\" said he, \"feel under my jaw.\"\\n\\nMowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera\\'s silky\\nchin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair,\\nhe came upon a little bald spot.\\n\\n\"There is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry that\\nmark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was born among\\nmen, and it was among men that my mother died--in the cages of the\\nking\\'s palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that I paid the price\\nfor thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too\\nwas born among men. I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind\\nbars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the\\nPanther--and no man\\'s plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one\\nblow of my paw and came away. And because I had learned the ways of men,\\nI became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mowgli, \"all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, thou art a man\\'s cub,\" said the Black Panther very tenderly. \"And\\neven as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to\\nthe men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council.\"\\n\\n\"But why--but why should any wish to kill me?\" said Mowgli.\\n\\n\"Look at me,\" said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him steadily between\\nthe eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.\\n\\n\"That is why,\" he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. \"Not even I can\\nlook thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love thee,\\nLittle Brother. The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet\\nthine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out thorns from\\ntheir feet--because thou art a man.\"\\n\\n\"I did not know these things,\" said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned\\nunder his heavy black eyebrows.\\n\\n\"What is the Law of the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By\\nthy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise. It is\\nin my heart that when Akela misses his next kill--and at each hunt\\nit costs him more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him and\\nagainst thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock, and then--and\\nthen--I have it!\" said Bagheera, leaping up. \"Go thou down quickly to\\nthe men\\'s huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they\\ngrow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger\\nfriend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love thee. Get the Red\\nFlower.\"\\n\\nBy Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will\\ncall fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it,\\nand invents a hundred ways of describing it.\\n\\n\"The Red Flower?\" said Mowgli. \"That grows outside their huts in the\\ntwilight. I will get some.\"\\n\\n\"There speaks the man\\'s cub,\" said Bagheera proudly. \"Remember that it\\ngrows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of\\nneed.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" said Mowgli. \"I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera\"--he\\nslipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big\\neyes--\"art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan\\'s doing?\"\\n\\n\"By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.\"\\n\\n\"Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for\\nthis, and it may be a little over,\" said Mowgli, and he bounded away.\\n\\n\"That is a man. That is all a man,\" said Bagheera to himself, lying down\\nagain. \"Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt\\nof thine ten years ago!\"\\n\\nMowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his heart\\nwas hot in him. He came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew\\nbreath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother\\nWolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that something was\\ntroubling her frog.\\n\\n\"What is it, Son?\" she said.\\n\\n\"Some bat\\'s chatter of Shere Khan,\" he called back. \"I hunt among the\\nplowed fields tonight,\" and he plunged downward through the bushes, to\\nthe stream at the bottom of the valley. There he checked, for he heard\\nthe yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur,\\nand the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter\\nhowls from the young wolves: \"Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show his\\nstrength. Room for the leader of the Pack! Spring, Akela!\"\\n\\nThe Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard the\\nsnap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with\\nhis forefoot.\\n\\nHe did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew\\nfainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers\\nlived.\\n\\n\"Bagheera spoke truth,\" he panted, as he nestled down in some cattle\\nfodder by the window of a hut. \"To-morrow is one day both for Akela and\\nfor me.\"\\n\\nThen he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on\\nthe hearth. He saw the husbandman\\'s wife get up and feed it in the night\\nwith black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white\\nand cold, he saw the man\\'s child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside\\nwith earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his\\nblanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre.\\n\\n\"Is that all?\" said Mowgli. \"If a cub can do it, there is nothing to\\nfear.\" So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from\\nhis hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.\\n\\n\"They are very like me,\" said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had\\nseen the woman do. \"This thing will die if I do not give it things to\\neat\"; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up\\nthe hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on\\nhis coat.\\n\\n\"Akela has missed,\" said the Panther. \"They would have killed him last\\nnight, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the\\nhill.\"\\n\\n\"I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!\" Mowgli held up the\\nfire-pot.\\n\\n\"Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and\\npresently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not\\nafraid?\"\\n\\n\"No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how,\\nbefore I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and\\npleasant.\"\\n\\nAll that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping\\ndry branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that\\nsatisfied him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told\\nhim rudely enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he laughed\\ntill Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing.\\n\\nAkela the Lone Wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the\\nleadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his following of\\nscrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera lay\\nclose to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgli\\'s knees. When they\\nwere all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing he would\\nnever have dared to do when Akela was in his prime.\\n\\n\"He has no right,\" whispered Bagheera. \"Say so. He is a dog\\'s son. He\\nwill be frightened.\"\\n\\nMowgli sprang to his feet. \"Free People,\" he cried, \"does Shere Khan\\nlead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?\"\\n\\n\"Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--\"\\nShere Khan began.\\n\\n\"By whom?\" said Mowgli. \"Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle\\nbutcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.\"\\n\\nThere were yells of \"Silence, thou man\\'s cub!\" \"Let him speak. He has\\nkept our Law\"; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: \"Let the\\nDead Wolf speak.\" When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is\\ncalled the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.\\n\\nAkela raised his old head wearily:--\\n\\n\"Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I\\nhave led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been\\ntrapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that plot\\nwas made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my\\nweakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on\\nthe Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the\\nLone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come\\none by one.\"\\n\\nThere was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to\\nthe death. Then Shere Khan roared: \"Bah! What have we to do with this\\ntoothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived too\\nlong. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me. I\\nam weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the jungle for ten\\nseasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give\\nyou one bone. He is a man, a man\\'s child, and from the marrow of my\\nbones I hate him!\"\\n\\nThen more than half the Pack yelled: \"A man! A man! What has a man to do\\nwith us? Let him go to his own place.\"\\n\\n\"And turn all the people of the villages against us?\" clamored Shere\\nKhan. \"No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him\\nbetween the eyes.\"\\n\\nAkela lifted his head again and said, \"He has eaten our food. He has\\nslept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the\\nLaw of the Jungle.\"\\n\\n\"Also, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a\\nbull is little, but Bagheera\\'s honor is something that he will perhaps\\nfight for,\" said Bagheera in his gentlest voice.\\n\\n\"A bull paid ten years ago!\" the Pack snarled. \"What do we care for\\nbones ten years old?\"\\n\\n\"Or for a pledge?\" said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip.\\n\"Well are ye called the Free People!\"\\n\\n\"No man\\'s cub can run with the people of the jungle,\" howled Shere Khan.\\n\"Give him to me!\"\\n\\n\"He is our brother in all but blood,\" Akela went on, \"and ye would kill\\nhim here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters of\\ncattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan\\'s teaching,\\nye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager\\'s doorstep.\\nTherefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is\\ncertain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer\\nthat in the man-cub\\'s place. But for the sake of the Honor of\\nthe Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader ye have\\nforgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his own place, I\\nwill not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I will\\ndie without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives.\\nMore I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that comes of\\nkilling a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother spoken for\\nand bought into the Pack according to the Law of the Jungle.\"\\n\\n\"He is a man--a man--a man!\" snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves\\nbegan to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.\\n\\n\"Now the business is in thy hands,\" said Bagheera to Mowgli. \"We can do\\nno more except fight.\"\\n\\nMowgli stood upright--the fire pot in his hands. Then he stretched out\\nhis arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he was furious with\\nrage and sorrow, for, wolflike, the wolves had never told him how they\\nhated him. \"Listen you!\" he cried. \"There is no need for this dog\\'s\\njabber. Ye have told me so often tonight that I am a man (and indeed I\\nwould have been a wolf with you to my life\\'s end) that I feel your words\\nare true. So I do not call ye my brothers any more, but sag [dogs], as\\na man should. What ye will do, and what ye will not do, is not yours\\nto say. That matter is with me; and that we may see the matter more\\nplainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of the Red Flower which\\nye, dogs, fear.\"\\n\\nHe flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit\\na tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in\\nterror before the leaping flames.\\n\\nMowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and\\ncrackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves.\\n\\n\"Thou art the master,\" said Bagheera in an undertone. \"Save Akela from\\nthe death. He was ever thy friend.\"\\n\\nAkela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave\\none piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black\\nhair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that\\nmade the shadows jump and quiver.\\n\\n\"Good!\" said Mowgli, staring round slowly. \"I see that ye are dogs. I go\\nfrom you to my own people--if they be my own people. The jungle is shut\\nto me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will be\\nmore merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood,\\nI promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as\\nye have betrayed me.\" He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks\\nflew up. \"There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here\\nis a debt to pay before I go.\" He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat\\nblinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.\\nBagheera followed in case of accidents. \"Up, dog!\" Mowgli cried. \"Up,\\nwhen a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!\"\\n\\nShere Khan\\'s ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for\\nthe blazing branch was very near.\\n\\n\"This cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he had\\nnot killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs\\nwhen we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down\\nthy gullet!\" He beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the\\ntiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear.\\n\\n\"Pah! Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the\\nCouncil Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan\\'s hide\\non my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye will\\nnot kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye\\nwill sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were\\nsomebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!\" The fire was\\nburning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right\\nand left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks\\nburning their fur. At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps\\nten wolves that had taken Mowgli\\'s part. Then something began to hurt\\nMowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt in his life before, and he\\ncaught his breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his face.\\n\\n\"What is it? What is it?\" he said. \"I do not wish to leave the jungle,\\nand I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?\"\\n\\n\"No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,\" said Bagheera.\\n\"Now I know thou art a man, and a man\\'s cub no longer. The jungle is\\nshut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only\\ntears.\" So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break; and he\\nhad never cried in all his life before.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to my\\nmother.\" And he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and\\nhe cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.\\n\\n\"Ye will not forget me?\" said Mowgli.\\n\\n\"Never while we can follow a trail,\" said the cubs. \"Come to the foot of\\nthe hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come\\ninto the croplands to play with thee by night.\"\\n\\n\"Come soon!\" said Father Wolf. \"Oh, wise little frog, come again soon;\\nfor we be old, thy mother and I.\"\\n\\n\"Come soon,\" said Mother Wolf, \"little naked son of mine. For, listen,\\nchild of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.\"\\n\\n\"I will surely come,\" said Mowgli. \"And when I come it will be to lay\\nout Shere Khan\\'s hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me! Tell them\\nin the jungle never to forget me!\"\\n\\nThe dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside\\nalone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\n\\n     As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled\\n        Once, twice and again!\\n     And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up\\n     From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.\\n     This I, scouting alone, beheld,\\n        Once, twice and again!\\n\\n     As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled\\n        Once, twice and again!\\n     And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back\\n     To carry the word to the waiting pack,\\n     And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track\\n        Once, twice and again!\\n\\n     As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled\\n        Once, twice and again!\\n     Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!\\n\\n     Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark!\\n     Tongue--give tongue to it!  Hark!  O hark!\\n        Once, twice and again!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKaa\\'s Hunting\\n\\n     His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the\\n        Buffalo\\'s pride.\\n     Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the\\n        gloss of his hide.\\n     If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed\\n        Sambhur can gore;\\n     Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons\\n        before.\\n     Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister\\n        and Brother,\\n     For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is\\n        their mother.\\n     \"There is none like to me!\" says the Cub in the pride of his\\n        earliest kill;\\n     But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small.  Let him\\n        think and be still.\\n                                 Maxims of Baloo\\n\\n\\nAll that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of\\nthe Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It\\nwas in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The\\nbig, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil,\\nfor the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle\\nas applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can\\nrepeat the Hunting Verse--\"Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in\\nthe dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white\\nteeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the\\nJackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.\" But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to\\nlearn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther\\nwould come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting\\non, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the\\nday\\'s lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could\\nswim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of\\nthe Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch\\nfrom a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came\\nupon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the\\nBat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the\\nwater-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them. None of\\nthe Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at\\nan intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers\\' Hunting Call,\\nwhich must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the\\nJungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, \"Give\\nme leave to hunt here because I am hungry.\" And the answer is, \"Hunt\\nthen for food, but not for pleasure.\"\\n\\nAll this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he\\ngrew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as\\nBaloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off\\nin a temper, \"A man\\'s cub is a man\\'s cub, and he must learn all the Law\\nof the Jungle.\"\\n\\n\"But think how small he is,\" said the Black Panther, who would have\\nspoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way. \"How can his little head carry\\nall thy long talk?\"\\n\\n\"Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is\\nwhy I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly,\\nwhen he forgets.\"\\n\\n\"Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?\" Bagheera\\ngrunted. \"His face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.\"\\n\\n\"Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than\\nthat he should come to harm through ignorance,\" Baloo answered very\\nearnestly. \"I am now teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that\\nshall protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all that hunt\\non four feet, except his own pack. He can now claim protection, if he\\nwill only remember the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that worth\\na little beating?\"\\n\\n\"Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub. He is no\\ntree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But what are those Master\\nWords? I am more likely to give help than to ask it\"--Bagheera stretched\\nout one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end\\nof it--\"still I should like to know.\"\\n\\n\"I will call Mowgli and he shall say them--if he will. Come, Little\\nBrother!\"\\n\\n\"My head is ringing like a bee tree,\" said a sullen little voice over\\ntheir heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant,\\nadding as he reached the ground: \"I come for Bagheera and not for thee,\\nfat old Baloo!\"\\n\\n\"That is all one to me,\" said Baloo, though he was hurt and grieved.\\n\"Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught\\nthee this day.\"\\n\\n\"Master Words for which people?\" said Mowgli, delighted to show off.\\n\"The jungle has many tongues. I know them all.\"\\n\\n\"A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank\\ntheir teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank\\nold Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People,\\nthen--great scholar.\"\\n\\n\"We be of one blood, ye and I,\" said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear\\naccent which all the Hunting People use.\\n\\n\"Good. Now for the birds.\"\\n\\nMowgli repeated, with the Kite\\'s whistle at the end of the sentence.\\n\\n\"Now for the Snake-People,\" said Bagheera.\\n\\nThe answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his\\nfeet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped\\non to Bagheera\\'s back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on\\nthe glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at Baloo.\\n\\n\"There--there! That was worth a little bruise,\" said the brown bear\\ntenderly. \"Some day thou wilt remember me.\" Then he turned aside to\\ntell Bagheera how he had begged the Master Words from Hathi the Wild\\nElephant, who knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken\\nMowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a water-snake, because\\nBaloo could not pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe\\nagainst all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor\\nbeast would hurt him.\\n\\n\"No one then is to be feared,\" Baloo wound up, patting his big furry\\nstomach with pride.\\n\\n\"Except his own tribe,\" said Bagheera, under his breath; and then aloud\\nto Mowgli, \"Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this\\ndancing up and down?\"\\n\\nMowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheera\\'s\\nshoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him he was\\nshouting at the top of his voice, \"And so I shall have a tribe of my\\nown, and lead them through the branches all day long.\"\\n\\n\"What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?\" said Bagheera.\\n\\n\"Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,\" Mowgli went on. \"They\\nhave promised me this. Ah!\"\\n\\n\"Whoof!\" Baloo\\'s big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera\\'s back, and as the\\nboy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.\\n\\n\"Mowgli,\" said Baloo, \"thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the\\nMonkey People.\"\\n\\nMowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and\\nBagheera\\'s eyes were as hard as jade stones.\\n\\n\"Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people\\nwithout a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.\"\\n\\n\"When Baloo hurt my head,\" said Mowgli (he was still on his back), \"I\\nwent away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on\\nme. No one else cared.\" He snuffled a little.\\n\\n\"The pity of the Monkey People!\" Baloo snorted. \"The stillness of the\\nmountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?\"\\n\\n\"And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and\\nthey--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said\\nI was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their\\nleader some day.\"\\n\\n\"They have no leader,\" said Bagheera. \"They lie. They have always lied.\"\\n\\n\"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken\\namong the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do\\nnot hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad\\nBaloo, let me up! I will play with them again.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, man-cub,\" said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on\\na hot night. \"I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the\\npeoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.\\nThey have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own,\\nbut use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,\\nand wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are\\nwithout leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and\\npretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the\\njungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all\\nis forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not\\ndrink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do\\nnot hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever\\nheard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo\\nhad finished.\\n\\n\"The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds.\\nThey are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they\\nhave any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not\\nnotice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down\\nthrough the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and\\nangry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.\\n\\n\"The Monkey-People are forbidden,\" said Baloo, \"forbidden to the\\nJungle-People. Remember.\"\\n\\n\"Forbidden,\" said Bagheera, \"but I still think Baloo should have warned\\nthee against them.\"\\n\\n\"I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey\\nPeople! Faugh!\"\\n\\nA fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking\\nMowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly\\ntrue. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look\\nup, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross\\neach other\\'s path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded\\ntiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks\\nand nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then\\nthey would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People\\nto climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles\\nover nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the\\nJungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a\\nleader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because\\ntheir memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they\\ncompromised things by making up a saying, \"What the Bandar-log think now\\nthe jungle will think later,\" and that comforted them a great deal. None\\nof the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts\\nwould notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli\\ncame to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.\\n\\nThey never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at\\nall; but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea, and\\nhe told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in\\nthe tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection from\\nthe wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him teach them.\\nOf course Mowgli, as a woodcutter\\'s child, inherited all sorts of\\ninstincts, and used to make little huts of fallen branches without\\nthinking how he came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees,\\nconsidered his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were\\nreally going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the\\njungle--so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore\\nthey followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very\\nquietly till it was time for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was\\nvery much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,\\nresolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.\\n\\nThe next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and\\narms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash of branches in his\\nface, and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo\\nwoke the jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk\\nwith every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled\\naway to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting:\\n\"He has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People\\nadmire us for our skill and our cunning.\" Then they began their flight;\\nand the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of\\nthe things nobody can describe. They have their regular roads and\\ncrossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy\\nor a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at\\nnight if necessary. Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under\\nthe arms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a\\nbound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the\\nboy\\'s weight held them back. Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he could not\\nhelp enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down below\\nfrightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing\\nover nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth. His\\nescort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost\\nbranches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop\\nwould fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring\\nup, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next\\ntree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green\\njungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea,\\nand then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face, and he\\nand his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and\\ncrashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept\\nalong the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.\\n\\nFor a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew\\nbetter than to struggle, and then he began to think. The first thing was\\nto send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys\\nwere going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless\\nto look down, for he could only see the topsides of the branches, so he\\nstared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing\\nand wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die.\\nRann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a\\nfew hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He\\nwhistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop\\nand heard him give the Kite call for--\"We be of one blood, thou and I.\"\\nThe waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to\\nthe next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. \"Mark\\nmy trail!\" Mowgli shouted. \"Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera\\nof the Council Rock.\"\\n\\n\"In whose name, Brother?\" Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of\\ncourse he had heard of him.\\n\\n\"Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!\"\\n\\nThe last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but\\nRann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust,\\nand there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the\\ntreetops as Mowgli\\'s escort whirled along.\\n\\n\"They never go far,\" he said with a chuckle. \"They never do what they\\nset out to do. Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log. This\\ntime, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for\\nthemselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill\\nmore than goats.\"\\n\\nSo he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited.\\n\\nMeantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera\\nclimbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke\\nbeneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark.\\n\\n\"Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?\" he roared to poor Baloo, who had\\nset off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys. \"What\\nwas the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him?\"\\n\\n\"Haste! O haste! We--we may catch them yet!\" Baloo panted.\\n\\n\"At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the\\nLaw--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee\\nopen. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing.\\nThey may drop him if we follow too close.\"\\n\\n\"Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him already, being tired of\\ncarrying him. Who can trust the Bandar-log? Put dead bats on my head!\\nGive me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees\\nthat I may be stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most\\nmiserable of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why did I not\\nwarn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now\\nperhaps I may have knocked the day\\'s lesson out of his mind, and he will\\nbe alone in the jungle without the Master Words.\"\\n\\nBaloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning.\\n\\n\"At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago,\" said\\nBagheera impatiently. \"Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect. What\\nwould the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like\\nIkki the Porcupine, and howled?\"\\n\\n\"What do I care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now.\"\\n\\n\"Unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or kill him\\nout of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He is wise and well\\ntaught, and above all he has the eyes that make the Jungle-People\\nafraid. But (and it is a great evil) he is in the power of the\\nBandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have no fear of any of\\nour people.\" Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am,\" said\\nBaloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, \"it is true what Hathi the Wild\\nElephant says: `To each his own fear\\'; and they, the Bandar-log, fear\\nKaa the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as they can. He steals the\\nyoung monkeys in the night. The whisper of his name makes their wicked\\ntails cold. Let us go to Kaa.\"\\n\\n\"What will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and\\nwith most evil eyes,\" said Bagheera.\\n\\n\"He is very old and very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry,\" said\\nBaloo hopefully. \"Promise him many goats.\"\\n\\n\"He sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep\\nnow, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?\"\\nBagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.\\n\\n\"Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see\\nreason.\" Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the Panther,\\nand they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.\\n\\nThey found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,\\nadmiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in retirement for the\\nlast ten days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting\\nhis big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet\\nof his body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his lips as he\\nthought of his dinner to come.\\n\\n\"He has not eaten,\" said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as\\nhe saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket. \"Be careful,\\nBagheera! He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and\\nvery quick to strike.\"\\n\\nKaa was not a poison snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes\\nas cowards--but his strength lay in his hug, and when he had once\\nlapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said. \"Good\\nhunting!\" cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches. Like all snakes of\\nhis breed Kaa was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at first. Then\\nhe curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered.\\n\\n\"Good hunting for us all,\" he answered. \"Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do\\nhere? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs food. Is there\\nany news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty\\nas a dried well.\"\\n\\n\"We are hunting,\" said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry\\nKaa. He is too big.\\n\\n\"Give me permission to come with you,\" said Kaa. \"A blow more or less is\\nnothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for\\ndays in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a\\nyoung ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they were when I was young.\\nRotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,\" said\\nBaloo.\\n\\n\"I am a fair length--a fair length,\" said Kaa with a little pride. \"But\\nfor all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very\\nnear to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my\\nslipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the\\nBandar-log, and they called me most evil names.\"\\n\\n\"Footless, yellow earth-worm,\" said Bagheera under his whiskers, as\\nthough he were trying to remember something.\\n\\n\"Sssss! Have they ever called me that?\" said Kaa.\\n\\n\"Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we\\nnever noticed them. They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all\\nthy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because (they\\nare indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid of the\\nhe-goat\\'s horns,\" Bagheera went on sweetly.\\n\\nNow a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows\\nthat he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing\\nmuscles on either side of Kaa\\'s throat ripple and bulge.\\n\\n\"The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,\" he said quietly. \"When I\\ncame up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.\"\\n\\n\"It--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,\" said Baloo, but the words\\nstuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one\\nof the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the\\nmonkeys.\\n\\n\"Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such\\nhunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the\\nBandar-log,\" Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity.\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" Baloo began, \"I am no more than the old and sometimes very\\nfoolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera\\nhere--\"\\n\\n\"Is Bagheera,\" said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap,\\nfor he did not believe in being humble. \"The trouble is this, Kaa. Those\\nnut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of\\nwhom thou hast perhaps heard.\"\\n\\n\"I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a\\nman-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki\\nis full of stories half heard and very badly told.\"\\n\\n\"But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,\" said Baloo. \"The\\nbest and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall\\nmake the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides,\\nI--we--love him, Kaa.\"\\n\\n\"Ts! Ts!\" said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. \"I also have known what\\nlove is. There are tales I could tell that--\"\\n\\n\"That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,\"\\nsaid Bagheera quickly. \"Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log\\nnow, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.\"\\n\\n\"They fear me alone. They have good reason,\" said Kaa. \"Chattering,\\nfoolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys. But a\\nman-thing in their hands is in no good luck. They grow tired of the nuts\\nthey pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning\\nto do great things with it, and then they snap it in two. That man-thing\\nis not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish\\' was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Worm--worm--earth-worm,\" said Bagheera, \"as well as other things which\\nI cannot now say for shame.\"\\n\\n\"We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must\\nhelp their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?\"\\n\\n\"The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,\" said Baloo. \"We\\nhad thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.\"\\n\\n\"I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the\\nBandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.\"\\n\\n\"Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf\\nPack!\"\\n\\nBaloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the\\nKite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his\\nwings. It was near Rann\\'s bedtime, but he had ranged all over the jungle\\nlooking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" said Baloo.\\n\\n\"I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He bade me tell you. I\\nwatched. The Bandar-log have taken him beyond the river to the monkey\\ncity--to the Cold Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten nights,\\nor an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is\\nmy message. Good hunting, all you below!\"\\n\\n\"Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,\" cried Bagheera. \"I will\\nremember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O\\nbest of kites!\"\\n\\n\"It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could\\nhave done no less,\" and Rann circled up again to his roost.\\n\\n\"He has not forgotten to use his tongue,\" said Baloo with a chuckle of\\npride. \"To think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the\\nbirds too while he was being pulled across trees!\"\\n\\n\"It was most firmly driven into him,\" said Bagheera. \"But I am proud of\\nhim, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.\"\\n\\nThey all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever\\nwent there, because what they called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted\\ncity, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that\\nmen have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not.\\nBesides, the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live\\nanywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it\\nexcept in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs\\nheld a little water.\\n\\n\"It is half a night\\'s journey--at full speed,\" said Bagheera, and Baloo\\nlooked very serious. \"I will go as fast as I can,\" he said anxiously.\\n\\n\"We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the\\nquick-foot--Kaa and I.\"\\n\\n\"Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four,\" said Kaa shortly.\\nBaloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and so they\\nleft him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the quick\\npanther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the\\nhuge Rock-python held level with him. When they came to a hill stream,\\nBagheera gained, because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and\\ntwo feet of his neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up\\nthe distance.\\n\\n\"By the Broken Lock that freed me,\" said Bagheera, when twilight had\\nfallen, \"thou art no slow goer!\"\\n\\n\"I am hungry,\" said Kaa. \"Besides, they called me speckled frog.\"\\n\\n\"Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot.\"\\n\\n\"All one. Let us go on,\" and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the\\nground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and keeping to\\nit.\\n\\nIn the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli\\'s\\nfriends at all. They had brought the boy to the Lost City, and were\\nvery much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an\\nIndian city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed\\nvery wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long ago on a little\\nhill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the\\nruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted\\nhinges. Trees had grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were\\ntumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of\\nthe towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.\\n\\nA great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the\\ncourtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red and green,\\nand the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king\\'s elephants\\nused to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees.\\nFrom the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that\\nmade up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness;\\nthe shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where\\nfour roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public\\nwells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs\\nsprouting on their sides. The monkeys called the place their city, and\\npretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest.\\nAnd yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to\\nuse them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the king\\'s council\\nchamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run\\nin and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old\\nbricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight\\nand cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the\\nterraces of the king\\'s garden, where they would shake the rose trees and\\nthe oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They explored\\nall the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of\\nlittle dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what\\nthey had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling\\neach other that they were doing as men did. They drank at the tanks and\\nmade the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they\\nwould all rush together in mobs and shout: \"There is no one in the\\njungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the\\nBandar-log.\" Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city\\nand went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice\\nthem.\\n\\nMowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like\\nor understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold\\nLairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli\\nwould have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about\\nand sang their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told\\nhis companions that Mowgli\\'s capture marked a new thing in the history\\nof the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks\\nand canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked\\nup some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys\\ntried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began\\nto pull their friends\\' tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.\\n\\n\"I wish to eat,\" said Mowgli. \"I am a stranger in this part of the\\njungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.\"\\n\\nTwenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild\\npawpaws. But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much\\ntrouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and\\nangry as well as hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the\\nStrangers\\' Hunting Call from time to time, but no one answered him, and\\nMowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed. \"All that Baloo\\nhas said about the Bandar-log is true,\" he thought to himself. \"They\\nhave no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish words\\nand little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here,\\nit will be all my own fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle.\\nBaloo will surely beat me, but that is better than chasing silly rose\\nleaves with the Bandar-log.\"\\n\\nNo sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him\\nback, telling him that he did not know how happy he was, and pinching\\nhim to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but\\nwent with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone\\nreservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined\\nsummer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for\\nqueens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and\\nblocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the\\nqueens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble\\ntracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians\\nand jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it\\nshone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black\\nvelvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not\\nhelp laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him\\nhow great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he\\nwas to wish to leave them. \"We are great. We are free. We are wonderful.\\nWe are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and\\nso it must be true,\" they shouted. \"Now as you are a new listener and\\ncan carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us\\nin future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves.\" Mowgli\\nmade no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on\\nthe terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the\\nBandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would\\nall shout together: \"This is true; we all say so.\" Mowgli nodded and\\nblinked, and said \"Yes\" when they asked him a question, and his head\\nspun with the noise. \"Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these\\npeople,\" he said to himself, \"and now they have madness. Certainly this\\nis dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud\\ncoming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might\\ntry to run away in the darkness. But I am tired.\"\\n\\nThat same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined\\nditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how\\ndangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run\\nany risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and\\nfew in the jungle care for those odds.\\n\\n\"I will go to the west wall,\" Kaa whispered, \"and come down swiftly with\\nthe slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon\\nmy back in their hundreds, but--\"\\n\\n\"I know it,\" said Bagheera. \"Would that Baloo were here, but we must do\\nwhat we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace.\\nThey hold some sort of council there over the boy.\"\\n\\n\"Good hunting,\" said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That\\nhappened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed\\nawhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,\\nand as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheera\\'s light\\nfeet on the terrace. The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost\\nwithout a sound and was striking--he knew better than to waste time in\\nbiting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli\\nin circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage,\\nand then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him,\\na monkey shouted: \"There is only one here! Kill him! Kill.\" A scuffling\\nmass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over\\nBagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up the wall\\nof the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome.\\nA man-trained boy would have been badly bruised, for the fall was a\\ngood fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and\\nlanded on his feet.\\n\\n\"Stay there,\" shouted the monkeys, \"till we have killed thy friends, and\\nlater we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.\"\\n\\n\"We be of one blood, ye and I,\" said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake\\'s\\nCall. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him\\nand gave the Call a second time, to make sure.\\n\\n\"Even ssso! Down hoods all!\" said half a dozen low voices (every ruin\\nin India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old\\nsummerhouse was alive with cobras). \"Stand still, Little Brother, for\\nthy feet may do us harm.\"\\n\\nMowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and\\nlistening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther--the\\nyells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera\\'s deep, hoarse cough\\nas he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his\\nenemies. For the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for\\nhis life.\\n\\n\"Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,\" Mowgli\\nthought. And then he called aloud: \"To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the\\nwater tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!\"\\n\\nBagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new\\ncourage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the\\nreservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the\\njungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done\\nhis best, but he could not come before. \"Bagheera,\" he shouted, \"I am\\nhere. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my feet! Wait my\\ncoming, O most infamous Bandar-log!\" He panted up the terrace only\\nto disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself\\nsquarely on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as\\nmany as he could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat,\\nlike the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told\\nMowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys\\ncould not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just\\nout of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps,\\ndancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon him from all sides\\nif he came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his\\ndripping chin, and in despair gave the Snake\\'s Call for protection--\"We\\nbe of one blood, ye and I\"--for he believed that Kaa had turned tail\\nat the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on\\nthe edge of the terrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black\\nPanther asking for help.\\n\\nKaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a\\nwrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch. He had no intention\\nof losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself\\nonce or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in\\nworking order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the\\nmonkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to\\nand fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even\\nHathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of\\nthe Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their\\ncomrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the\\nday birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious\\nto kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of\\nhis head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can\\nimagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half\\na ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can\\nroughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five\\nfeet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and\\nKaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His first stroke was delivered\\ninto the heart of the crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut\\nmouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys\\nscattered with cries of--\"Kaa! It is Kaa! Run! Run!\"\\n\\nGenerations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories\\ntheir elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who could slip along the\\nbranches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey\\nthat ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead\\nbranch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived, till the branch\\ncaught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle,\\nfor none of them knew the limits of his power, none of them could look\\nhim in the face, and none had ever come alive out of his hug. And so\\nthey ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the\\nhouses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief. His fur was much thicker\\nthan Bagheera\\'s, but he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa\\nopened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word, and\\nthe far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed\\nwhere they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled\\nunder them. The monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped\\ntheir cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard\\nBagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank. Then the\\nclamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They\\nclung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they\\nskipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,\\nput his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his front\\nteeth, to show his derision and contempt.\\n\\n\"Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,\" Bagheera gasped.\\n\"Let us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again.\"\\n\\n\"They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!\" Kaa hissed, and\\nthe city was silent once more. \"I could not come before, Brother, but I\\nthink I heard thee call\"--this was to Bagheera.\\n\\n\"I--I may have cried out in the battle,\" Bagheera answered. \"Baloo, art\\nthou hurt?\\n\\n\"I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little\\nbearlings,\" said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. \"Wow! I\\nam sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I.\"\\n\\n\"No matter. Where is the manling?\"\\n\\n\"Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out,\" cried Mowgli. The curve of the\\nbroken dome was above his head.\\n\\n\"Take him away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our\\nyoung,\" said the cobras inside.\\n\\n\"Hah!\" said Kaa with a chuckle, \"he has friends everywhere, this\\nmanling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break\\ndown the wall.\"\\n\\nKaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble\\ntracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head\\nto get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear\\nof the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows,\\nnose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and\\nrubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between\\nBaloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.\\n\\n\"Art thou hurt?\" said Baloo, hugging him softly.\\n\\n\"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled\\nye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.\"\\n\\n\"Others also,\" said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the\\nmonkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.\\n\\n\"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all\\nlittle frogs!\" whimpered Baloo.\\n\\n\"Of that we shall judge later,\" said Bagheera, in a dry voice that\\nMowgli did not at all like. \"But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle\\nand thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli.\"\\n\\nMowgli turned and saw the great Python\\'s head swaying a foot above his\\nown.\\n\\n\"So this is the manling,\" said Kaa. \"Very soft is his skin, and he is\\nnot unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake\\nthee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.\"\\n\\n\"We be one blood, thou and I,\" Mowgli answered. \"I take my life from\\nthee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.\"\\n\\n\"All thanks, Little Brother,\" said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. \"And\\nwhat may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he\\ngoes abroad.\"\\n\\n\"I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can\\nuse them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth.\\nI have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art\\nin a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to\\nBaloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.\"\\n\\n\"Well said,\" growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very\\nprettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli\\'s\\nshoulder. \"A brave heart and a courteous tongue,\" said he. \"They shall\\ncarry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly\\nwith thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it\\nis not well that thou shouldst see.\"\\n\\nThe moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys\\nhuddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky\\nfringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera\\nbegan to put his fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the\\nterrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all\\nthe monkeys\\' eyes upon him.\\n\\n\"The moon sets,\" he said. \"Is there yet light enough to see?\"\\n\\nFrom the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--\"We see, O\\nKaa.\"\\n\\n\"Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still\\nand watch.\"\\n\\nHe turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right\\nto left. Then he began making loops and figures of eight with his\\nbody, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided\\nfigures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never\\nstopping his low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last\\nthe dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle\\nof the scales.\\n\\nBaloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats,\\ntheir neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.\\n\\n\"Bandar-log,\" said the voice of Kaa at last, \"can ye stir foot or hand\\nwithout my order? Speak!\"\\n\\n\"Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!\"\\n\\n\"Good! Come all one pace nearer to me.\"\\n\\nThe lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and\\nBagheera took one stiff step forward with them.\\n\\n\"Nearer!\" hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.\\n\\nMowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the\\ntwo great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.\\n\\n\"Keep thy hand on my shoulder,\" Bagheera whispered. \"Keep it there, or I\\nmust go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!\"\\n\\n\"It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,\" said Mowgli. \"Let us\\ngo.\" And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.\\n\\n\"Whoof!\" said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. \"Never\\nmore will I make an ally of Kaa,\" and he shook himself all over.\\n\\n\"He knows more than we,\" said Bagheera, trembling. \"In a little time,\\nhad I stayed, I should have walked down his throat.\"\\n\\n\"Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again,\" said Baloo.\\n\"He will have good hunting--after his own fashion.\"\\n\\n\"But what was the meaning of it all?\" said Mowgli, who did not know\\nanything of a python\\'s powers of fascination. \"I saw no more than a big\\nsnake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all\\nsore. Ho! Ho!\"\\n\\n\"Mowgli,\" said Bagheera angrily, \"his nose was sore on thy account, as\\nmy ears and sides and paws, and Baloo\\'s neck and shoulders are bitten\\non thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with\\npleasure for many days.\"\\n\\n\"It is nothing,\" said Baloo; \"we have the man-cub again.\"\\n\\n\"True, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in\\ngood hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and\\nlast of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black\\nPanther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I\\nwere both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this,\\nman-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log.\"\\n\\n\"True, it is true,\" said Mowgli sorrowfully. \"I am an evil man-cub, and\\nmy stomach is sad in me.\"\\n\\n\"Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?\"\\n\\nBaloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could\\nnot tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: \"Sorrow never stays punishment.\\nBut remember, Bagheera, he is very little.\"\\n\\n\"I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now.\\nMowgli, hast thou anything to say?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just.\"\\n\\nBagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther\\'s point of\\nview (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a\\nseven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could\\nwish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself\\nup without a word.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Bagheera, \"jump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go\\nhome.\"\\n\\nOne of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores.\\nThere is no nagging afterward.\\n\\nMowgli laid his head down on Bagheera\\'s back and slept so deeply that he\\nnever waked when he was put down in the home-cave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoad-Song of the Bandar-Log\\n\\n     Here we go in a flung festoon,\\n     Half-way up to the jealous moon!\\n     Don\\'t you envy our pranceful bands?\\n     Don\\'t you wish you had extra hands?\\n     Wouldn\\'t you like if your tails were--so--\\n     Curved in the shape of a Cupid\\'s bow?\\n        Now you\\'re angry, but--never mind,\\n        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!\\n\\n     Here we sit in a branchy row,\\n     Thinking of beautiful things we know;\\n     Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,\\n     All complete, in a minute or two--\\n     Something noble and wise and good,\\n     Done by merely wishing we could.\\n        We\\'ve forgotten, but--never mind,\\n        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!\\n\\n     All the talk we ever have heard\\n     Uttered by bat or beast or bird--\\n     Hide or fin or scale or feather--\\n     Jabber it quickly and all together!\\n     Excellent!

When Mowgli left the wolf\\'s cave\\nafter the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he went down to the\\nplowed lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop there\\nbecause it was too near to the jungle, and he knew that he had made at\\nleast one bad enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to\\nthe rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady\\njog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he came to a country that he\\ndid not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with\\nrocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at\\nthe other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds,\\nand stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the\\nplain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in\\ncharge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow\\npariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked\\non, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village gate he\\nsaw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight,\\npushed to one side.\\n\\n\"Umph!\" he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade in\\nhis night rambles after things to eat. \"So men are afraid of the People\\nof the Jungle here also.\" He sat down by the gate, and when a man came\\nout he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to show that\\nhe wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the\\nvillage shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in\\nwhite, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. The priest came to\\nthe gate, and with him at least a hundred people, who stared and talked\\nand shouted and pointed at Mowgli.\\n\\n\"They have no manners, these Men Folk,\" said Mowgli to himself. \"Only\\nthe gray ape would behave as they do.\" So he threw back his long hair\\nand frowned at the crowd.\\n\\n\"What is there to be afraid of?\" said the priest. \"Look at the marks on\\nhis arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child\\nrun away from the jungle.\"\\n\\nOf course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder\\nthan they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and\\nlegs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these\\nbites, for he knew what real biting meant.\\n\\n\"Arre! Arre!\" said two or three women together. \"To be bitten by wolves,\\npoor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire. By my\\nhonor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger.\"\\n\\n\"Let me look,\" said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and\\nankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. \"Indeed he\\nis not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.\"\\n\\nThe priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the\\nrichest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a minute\\nand said solemnly: \"What the jungle has taken the jungle has restored.\\nTake the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the\\npriest who sees so far into the lives of men.\"\\n\\n\"By the Bull that bought me,\" said Mowgli to himself, \"but all this\\ntalking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a\\nman I must become.\"\\n\\nThe crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there\\nwas a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny\\nraised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a\\nHindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such\\nas they sell at the country fairs.\\n\\nShe gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her\\nhand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that\\nhe might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had\\ntaken him. So she said, \"Nathoo, O Nathoo!\" Mowgli did not show that he\\nknew the name. \"Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new\\nshoes?\" She touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. \"No,\"\\nshe said sorrowfully, \"those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art\\nvery like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.\"\\n\\nMowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as\\nhe looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he\\nwanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. \"What is the\\ngood of a man,\" he said to himself at last, \"if he does not understand\\nman\\'s talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the\\njungle. I must speak their talk.\"\\n\\nIt was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to\\nimitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little\\nwild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate\\nit almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many\\nthings in the hut.\\n\\nThere was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under\\nanything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they\\nshut the door he went through the window. \"Give him his will,\" said\\nMessua\\'s husband. \"Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed.\\nIf he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away.\"\\n\\nSo Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of\\nthe field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him\\nunder the chin.\\n\\n\"Phew!\" said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf\\'s cubs).\\n\"This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest\\nof wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little\\nBrother; I bring news.\"\\n\\n\"Are all well in the jungle?\" said Mowgli, hugging him.\\n\\n\"All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now,\\nlisten. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows\\nagain, for he is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will\\nlay thy bones in the Waingunga.\"\\n\\n\"There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But\\nnews is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things,\\nGray Brother,--but bring me the news always.\"\\n\\n\"Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee\\nforget?\" said Gray Brother anxiously.\\n\\n\"Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But\\nalso I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.\"\\n\\n\"And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,\\nLittle Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When\\nI come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge\\nof the grazing-ground.\"\\n\\nFor three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village\\ngate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had\\nto wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had\\nto learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and\\nabout plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children\\nin the village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had\\ntaught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on\\nkeeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not\\nplay games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the\\nknowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him\\nfrom picking them up and breaking them in two.\\n\\nHe did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he\\nwas weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that\\nhe was as strong as a bull.\\n\\nAnd Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes\\nbetween man and man. When the potter\\'s donkey slipped in the clay pit,\\nMowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their\\njourney to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for\\nthe potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest\\nscolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the\\npriest told Messua\\'s husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as\\nsoon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would\\nhave to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they\\ngrazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he\\nhad been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off\\nto a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great\\nfig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and\\nthe barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the\\nvillage hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys\\nsat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the\\nplatform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk\\nevery night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree\\nand talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into\\nthe night. They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and\\nBuldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the\\njungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged\\nout of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle\\nwas always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their\\ncrops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within\\nsight of the village gates.\\n\\nMowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of,\\nhad to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo,\\nthe Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story\\nto another, and Mowgli\\'s shoulders shook.\\n\\nBuldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua\\'s son\\nwas a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked,\\nold money-lender, who had died some years ago. \"And I know that this is\\ntrue,\" he said, \"because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he\\ngot in a riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I\\nspeak of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal.\"\\n\\n\"True, true, that must be the truth,\" said the gray-beards, nodding\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?\" said Mowgli. \"That\\ntiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the\\nsoul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal\\nis child\\'s talk.\"\\n\\nBuldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man\\nstared.\\n\\n\"Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?\" said Buldeo. \"If thou art so\\nwise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set\\na hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders\\nspeak.\"\\n\\nMowgli rose to go. \"All the evening I have lain here listening,\" he\\ncalled back over his shoulder, \"and, except once or twice, Buldeo has\\nnot said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his very\\ndoors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and\\ngoblins which he says he has seen?\"\\n\\n\"It is full time that boy went to herding,\" said the head-man, while\\nBuldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli\\'s impertinence.\\n\\nThe custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle\\nand buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back\\nat night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow\\nthemselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that\\nhardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds\\nthey are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But\\nif they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes\\ncarried off. Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting\\non the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes,\\nwith their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their\\nbyres, one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to\\nthe children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with\\na long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the\\ncattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be\\nvery careful not to stray away from the herd.\\n\\nAn Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little\\nravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes\\ngenerally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing\\nor basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge\\nof the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped\\nfrom Rama\\'s neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.\\n\"Ah,\" said Gray Brother, \"I have waited here very many days. What is the\\nmeaning of this cattle-herding work?\"\\n\\n\"It is an order,\" said Mowgli. \"I am a village herd for a while. What\\nnews of Shere Khan?\"\\n\\n\"He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for\\nthee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to\\nkill thee.\"\\n\\n\"Very good,\" said Mowgli. \"So long as he is away do thou or one of the\\nfour brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of\\nthe village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak\\ntree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan\\'s\\nmouth.\"\\n\\nThen Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while\\nthe buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest\\nthings in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move\\non again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes\\nvery seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after\\nanother, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and\\nstaring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like\\nlogs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children\\nhear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead,\\nand they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep\\ndown, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and\\nthe next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be\\na score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and\\nwake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put\\ngrasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight;\\nor string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard\\nbasking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they\\nsing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and\\nthe day seems longer than most people\\'s whole lives, and perhaps they\\nmake a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and\\nput reeds into the men\\'s hands, and pretend that they are kings and the\\nfigures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then\\nevening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of\\nthe sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other,\\nand they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village\\nlights.\\n\\nDay after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and\\nday after day he would see Gray Brother\\'s back a mile and a half away\\nacross the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day\\nafter day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him,\\nand dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false\\nstep with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would\\nhave heard him in those long, still mornings.\\n\\nAt last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place,\\nand he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree,\\nwhich was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother,\\nevery bristle on his back lifted.\\n\\n\"He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed the\\nranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,\" said the Wolf,\\npanting.\\n\\nMowgli frowned. \"I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very\\ncunning.\"\\n\\n\"Have no fear,\" said Gray Brother, licking his lips a little. \"I met\\nTabaqui in the dawn. Now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites, but\\nhe told me everything before I broke his back. Shere Khan\\'s plan is to\\nwait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee and for no one\\nelse. He is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the Waingunga.\"\\n\\n\"Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?\" said Mowgli, for the answer\\nmeant life and death to him.\\n\\n\"He killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan\\ncould never fast, even for the sake of revenge.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Fool, fool! What a cub\\'s cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he\\nthinks that I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does he lie up?\\nIf there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies. These\\nbuffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot speak their\\nlanguage. Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?\"\\n\\n\"He swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,\" said Gray Brother.\\n\\n\"Tabaqui told him that, I know. He would never have thought of it\\nalone.\" Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth, thinking. \"The big\\nravine of the Waingunga. That opens out on the plain not half a mile\\nfrom here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of\\nthe ravine and then sweep down--but he would slink out at the foot. We\\nmust block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for\\nme?\"\\n\\n\"Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.\" Gray Brother trotted\\noff and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that\\nMowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry\\nof all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.\\n\\n\"Akela! Akela!\" said Mowgli, clapping his hands. \"I might have known\\nthat thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the\\nherd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and\\nthe plow buffaloes by themselves.\"\\n\\nThe two wolves ran, ladies\\'-chain fashion, in and out of the herd, which\\nsnorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps. In one,\\nthe cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared\\nand pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and\\ntrample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls\\nsnorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much\\nless dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have\\ndivided the herd so neatly.\\n\\n\"What orders!\" panted Akela. \"They are trying to join again.\"\\n\\nMowgli slipped on to Rama\\'s back. \"Drive the bulls away to the left,\\nAkela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive\\nthem into the foot of the ravine.\"\\n\\n\"How far?\" said Gray Brother, panting and snapping.\\n\\n\"Till the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump,\" shouted Mowgli.\\n\"Keep them there till we come down.\" The bulls swept off as Akela bayed,\\nand Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged down on him,\\nand he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela drove\\nthe bulls far to the left.\\n\\n\"Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful,\\nnow--careful, Akela. A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah!\\nThis is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these\\ncreatures could move so swiftly?\" Mowgli called.\\n\\n\"I have--have hunted these too in my time,\" gasped Akela in the dust.\\n\"Shall I turn them into the jungle?\"\\n\\n\"Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only\\ntell him what I need of him to-day.\"\\n\\nThe bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the\\nstanding thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half\\na mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry\\nthem, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.\\n\\nBut Mowgli\\'s plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a\\nbig circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the\\nbulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for\\nhe knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in\\nany condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was\\nsoothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the\\nrear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a\\nlong, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and\\ngive Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd\\nat the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to\\nthe ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the\\ntrees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides\\nof the ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they\\nran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung\\nover them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.\\n\\n\"Let them breathe, Akela,\" he said, holding up his hand. \"They have not\\nwinded him yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We\\nhave him in the trap.\"\\n\\nHe put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost\\nlike shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.\\n\\nAfter a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a\\nfull-fed tiger just wakened.\\n\\n\"Who calls?\" said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of\\nthe ravine screeching.\\n\\n\"I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!\\nDown--hurry them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!\"\\n\\nThe herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave\\ntongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the\\nother, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up\\nround them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before\\nthey were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and\\nbellowed.\\n\\n\"Ha! Ha!\" said Mowgli, on his back. \"Now thou knowest!\" and the torrent\\nof black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the\\nravine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being\\nshouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the\\ncreepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible\\ncharge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand.\\nShere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and\\nlumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of\\nescape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on,\\nheavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do anything rather than\\nfight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing\\ntill the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot\\nof the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came\\nto the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their\\ncalves), and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over\\nsomething soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the\\nother herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet\\nby the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the\\nplain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and\\nslipped off Rama\\'s neck, laying about him right and left with his stick.\\n\\n\"Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they will be fighting one\\nanother. Drive them away, Akela. Hai, Rama! Hai, hai, hai! my children.\\nSoftly now, softly! It is all over.\"\\n\\nAkela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes\\' legs,\\nand though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli\\nmanaged to turn Rama, and the others followed him to the wallows.\\n\\nShere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were\\ncoming for him already.\\n\\n\"Brothers, that was a dog\\'s death,\" said Mowgli, feeling for the knife\\nhe always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men.\\n\"But he would never have shown fight. His hide will look well on the\\nCouncil Rock. We must get to work swiftly.\"\\n\\nA boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot\\ntiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal\\'s\\nskin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work,\\nand Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves\\nlolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them.\\nPresently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with\\nthe Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo\\nstampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct\\nMowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of\\nsight as soon as they saw the man coming.\\n\\n\"What is this folly?\" said Buldeo angrily. \"To think that thou canst\\nskin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger\\ntoo, and there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well, well, we will\\noverlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one\\nof the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.\"\\nHe fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to\\nsinge Shere Khan\\'s whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tiger\\'s\\nwhiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a\\nforepaw. \"So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and\\nperhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for\\nmy own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!\"\\n\\n\"What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the\\nstupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The tiger has\\njust fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst\\nnot even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo,\\nmust be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one\\nanna of the reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!\"\\n\\n\"By the Bull that bought me,\" said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the\\nshoulder, \"must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela,\\nthis man plagues me.\"\\n\\nBuldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan\\'s head, found himself\\nsprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli\\nwent on skinning as though he were alone in all India.\\n\\n\"Ye-es,\" he said, between his teeth. \"Thou art altogether right, Buldeo.\\nThou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war\\nbetween this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won.\"\\n\\nTo do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have\\ntaken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf\\nwho obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating\\ntigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind,\\nthought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would\\nprotect him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see\\nMowgli turn into a tiger too.\\n\\n\"Maharaj! Great King,\" he said at last in a husky whisper.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little.\\n\\n\"I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a\\nherdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to\\npieces?\"\\n\\n\"Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my\\ngame. Let him go, Akela.\"\\n\\nBuldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back\\nover his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible.\\nWhen he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and\\nsorcery that made the priest look very grave.\\n\\nMowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and\\nthe wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.\\n\\n\"Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd\\nthem, Akela.\"\\n\\nThe herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the\\nvillage Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the temple\\nblowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him\\nby the gate. \"That is because I have killed Shere Khan,\" he said\\nto himself. But a shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the\\nvillagers shouted: \"Sorcerer! Wolf\\'s brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get\\nhence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot,\\nBuldeo, shoot!\"\\n\\nThe old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed\\nin pain.\\n\\n\"More sorcery!\" shouted the villagers. \"He can turn bullets. Buldeo,\\nthat was thy buffalo.\"\\n\\n\"Now what is this?\" said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker.\\n\\n\"They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,\" said Akela,\\nsitting down composedly. \"It is in my head that, if bullets mean\\nanything, they would cast thee out.\"\\n\\n\"Wolf! Wolf\\'s cub! Go away!\" shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the\\nsacred tulsi plant.\\n\\n\"Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I\\nam a wolf. Let us go, Akela.\"\\n\\nA woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: \"Oh, my son,\\nmy son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast\\nat will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo\\nsays thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo\\'s death.\"\\n\\n\"Come back, Messua!\" shouted the crowd. \"Come back, or we will stone\\nthee.\"\\n\\nMowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in\\nthe mouth. \"Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they tell\\nunder the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son\\'s life.\\nFarewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly\\nthan their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!\"\\n\\n\"Now, once more, Akela,\" he cried. \"Bring the herd in.\"\\n\\nThe buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly\\nneeded Akela\\'s yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,\\nscattering the crowd right and left.\\n\\n\"Keep count!\" shouted Mowgli scornfully. \"It may be that I have stolen\\none of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you\\nwell, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my\\nwolves and hunt you up and down your street.\"\\n\\nHe turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he\\nlooked up at the stars he felt happy. \"No more sleeping in traps for me,\\nAkela. Let us get Shere Khan\\'s skin and go away. No, we will not hurt\\nthe village, for Messua was kind to me.\"\\n\\nWhen the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the\\nhorrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a\\nbundle on his head, trotting across at the steady wolf\\'s trot that eats\\nup the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew\\nthe conches louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered\\nthe story of his adventures in the jungle, till he ended by saying that\\nAkela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man.\\n\\nThe moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the\\nhill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf\\'s cave.\\n\\n\"They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,\" shouted Mowgli, \"but\\nI come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.\"\\n\\nMother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and\\nher eyes glowed as she saw the skin.\\n\\n\"I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into\\nthis cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter\\nwould be the hunted. It is well done.\"\\n\\n\"Little Brother, it is well done,\" said a deep voice in the thicket.\\n\"We were lonely in the jungle without thee,\" and Bagheera came running\\nto Mowgli\\'s bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and\\nMowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit,\\nand pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon\\nit, and called the old call to the Council, \"Look--look well, O Wolves,\"\\nexactly as he had called when Mowgli was first brought there.\\n\\nEver since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader,\\nhunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered the call\\nfrom habit; and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen\\ninto, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating\\nbad food, and many were missing. But they came to the Council Rock, all\\nthat were left of them, and saw Shere Khan\\'s striped hide on the rock,\\nand the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet. It\\nwas then that Mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all\\nby itself, and he shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling\\nskin, and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left,\\nwhile Gray Brother and Akela howled between the verses.\\n\\n\"Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept my word?\" said Mowgli. And the wolves\\nbayed \"Yes,\" and one tattered wolf howled:\\n\\n\"Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of\\nthis lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" purred Bagheera, \"that may not be. When ye are full-fed, the\\nmadness may come upon you again. Not for nothing are ye called the Free\\nPeople. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves.\"\\n\\n\"Man-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,\" said Mowgli. \"Now I will hunt\\nalone in the jungle.\"\\n\\n\"And we will hunt with thee,\" said the four cubs.\\n\\nSo Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from\\nthat day on. But he was not always alone, because, years afterward, he\\nbecame a man and married.\\n\\nBut that is a story for grown-ups.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMowgli\\'s Song\\n\\n     THAT HE SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE\\n     DANCED ON SHERE KHAN\\'S HIDE\\n\\n     The Song of Mowgli--I, Mowgli, am singing.  Let the jungle\\n        listen to the things I have done.\\n\\n     Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill!  At the gates in the\\n        twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!\\n\\n     He ate and he drank.  Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou\\n        drink again?  Sleep and dream of the kill.\\n\\n     I am alone on the grazing-grounds.  Gray Brother, come to me!\\n        Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!\\n\\n     Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls\\n        with the angry eyes.  Drive them to and fro as I order.\\n\\n     Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan?  Wake, oh, wake!  Here come I,\\n        and the bulls are behind.\\n\\n     Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot.  Waters of\\n        the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan?\\n\\n     He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should\\n        fly.  He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches.  Little\\n        bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?\\n\\n     Ow!  He is there.  Ahoo!  He is there.  Under the feet of Rama\\n        lies the Lame One!  Up, Shere Khan!\\n\\n     Up and kill!  Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!\\n\\n     Hsh!  He is asleep.  We will not wake him, for his strength is\\n        very great.  The kites have come down to see it.  The black\\n        ants have come up to know it.  There is a great assembly in his\\n        honor.\\n\\n     Alala!  I have no cloth to wrap me.  The kites will see that I am\\n        naked.  I am ashamed to meet all these people.\\n\\n     Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan.  Lend me thy gay striped coat that I\\n        may go to the Council Rock.\\n\\n     By the Bull that bought me I made a promise--a little promise.\\n        Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.\\n\\n     With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the\\n        hunter, I will stoop down for my gift.\\n\\n     Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his coat for the love\\n        that he bears me.  Pull, Gray Brother!  Pull, Akela!  Heavy is\\n        the hide of Shere Khan.\\n\\n     The Man Pack are angry.  They throw stones and talk child\\'s talk.\\n        My mouth is bleeding.  Let me run away.\\n\\n     Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my\\n        brothers.  We will leave the lights of the village and go to\\n        the low moon.\\n\\n     Waters of the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out.  I did\\n        them no harm, but they were afraid of me.  Why?\\n\\n     Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and\\n        the village gates are shut.  Why?\\n\\n     As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the\\n        village and the jungle.  Why?\\n\\n     I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My\\n        mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but\\n        my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.\\n        Why?\\n\\n     These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the\\n        spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it\\n        falls.  Why?\\n\\n     I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.\\n\\n     All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.  Look--look\\n        well, O Wolves!\\n\\n     Ahae!  My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe White Seal\\n\\n     Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,\\n        And black are the waters that sparkled so green.\\n     The moon, o\\'er the combers, looks downward to find us\\n        At rest in the hollows that rustle between.\\n     Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow,\\n        Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!\\n     The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,\\n        Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas!\\n\\n                                              Seal Lullaby\\n\\n\\nAll these things happened several years ago at a place called\\nNovastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and\\naway in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale\\nwhen he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I\\ntook him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days\\ntill he was fit to fly back to St. Paul\\'s again. Limmershin is a very\\nquaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth.\\n\\nNobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people\\nwho have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer\\nmonths by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea.\\nFor Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any\\nplace in all the world.\\n\\nSea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place\\nhe happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for\\nNovastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good\\nplace on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was\\nfifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his\\nshoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved himself up on his\\nfront flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his\\nweight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven\\nhundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights,\\nbut he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head\\non one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face;\\nthen he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were\\nfirmly fixed on the other seal\\'s neck, the other seal might get away if\\nhe could, but Sea Catch would not help him.\\n\\nYet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules\\nof the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as\\nthere were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same\\nthing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the\\nbeach was something frightful.\\n\\nFrom a little hill called Hutchinson\\'s Hill, you could look over three\\nand a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was\\ndotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their\\nshare of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the\\nsand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries,\\nfor they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives\\nnever came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they\\ndid not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and\\nfour-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about\\nhalf a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the\\nsand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green\\nthing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and\\nthere were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah\\nalone.\\n\\nSea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when\\nMatkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea,\\nand he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his\\nreservation, saying gruffly: \"Late as usual. Where have you been?\"\\n\\nIt was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four\\nmonths he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad.\\nMatkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: \"How\\nthoughtful of you. You\\'ve taken the old place again.\"\\n\\n\"I should think I had,\" said Sea Catch. \"Look at me!\"\\n\\nHe was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out,\\nand his sides were torn to ribbons.\\n\\n\"Oh, you men, you men!\" Matkah said, fanning herself with her hind\\nflipper. \"Why can\\'t you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You\\nlook as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The\\nbeach is disgracefully crowded this season. I\\'ve met at least a hundred\\nseals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why can\\'t people stay where\\nthey belong?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter\\nIsland instead of this crowded place,\" said Matkah.\\n\\n\"Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they\\nwould say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.\"\\n\\nSea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended\\nto go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a\\nsharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were\\non the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the\\nloudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals\\non the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie,\\nfighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going\\ndown to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying\\nover every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing\\nabout in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at\\nNovastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look\\nall pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.\\n\\nKotick, Matkah\\'s baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he\\nwas all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals\\nmust be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother\\nlook at him very closely.\\n\\n\"Sea Catch,\" she said, at last, \"our baby\\'s going to be white!\"\\n\\n\"Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!\" snorted Sea Catch. \"There never has\\nbeen such a thing in the world as a white seal.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help that,\" said Matkah; \"there\\'s going to be now.\" And she\\nsang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their\\nbabies:\\n\\n     You mustn\\'t swim till you\\'re six weeks old,\\n        Or your head will be sunk by your heels;\\n     And summer gales and Killer Whales\\n        Are bad for baby seals.\\n\\n     Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,\\n        As bad as bad can be;\\n     But splash and grow strong,\\n     And you can\\'t be wrong.\\n        Child of the Open Sea!\\n\\nOf course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He\\npaddled and scrambled about by his mother\\'s side, and learned to scuffle\\nout of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the\\ntwo rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go\\nto sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days,\\nbut then he ate all he could and throve upon it.\\n\\nThe first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens\\nof thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like\\npuppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old\\npeople in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie\\nkept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.\\n\\nWhen Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight\\nto their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until\\nshe heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight\\nlines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking\\nthe youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few\\nhundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and\\nthe babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, \"So long as you\\ndon\\'t lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut\\nor scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy\\nsea, nothing will hurt you here.\"\\n\\nLittle seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy\\ntill they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave\\ncarried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little\\nhind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song,\\nand if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have\\ndrowned.\\n\\nAfter that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the\\nwaves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always\\nkept his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks\\nlearning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and\\nout of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and\\ntook catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found\\nthat he truly belonged to the water.\\n\\nThen you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking\\nunder the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a\\nswash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or\\nstanding up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did;\\nor playing \"I\\'m the King of the Castle\" on slippery, weedy rocks that\\njust stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like\\na big shark\\'s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that\\nwas the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get\\nthem; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin\\nwould jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.\\n\\nLate in October the seals began to leave St. Paul\\'s for the deep sea, by\\nfamilies and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,\\nand the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. \"Next year,\" said\\nMatkah to Kotick, \"you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must\\nlearn how to catch fish.\"\\n\\nThey set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how\\nto sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his\\nlittle nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the\\nlong, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all\\nover, Matkah told him he was learning the \"feel of the water,\" and that\\ntingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard\\nand get away.\\n\\n\"In a little time,\" she said, \"you\\'ll know where to swim to, but just\\nnow we\\'ll follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he is very wise.\" A school\\nof porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little\\nKotick followed them as fast as he could. \"How do you know where to go\\nto?\" he panted. The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked\\nunder. \"My tail tingles, youngster,\" he said. \"That means there\\'s a gale\\nbehind me. Come along! When you\\'re south of the Sticky Water [he meant\\nthe Equator] and your tail tingles, that means there\\'s a gale in front\\nof you and you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here.\"\\n\\nThis was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always\\nlearning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the\\nunder-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds;\\nhow to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart\\nlike a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes\\nran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing\\nall over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed\\nAlbatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to\\njump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers\\nclose to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone\\nbecause they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at\\nfull speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a\\nship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick\\ndid not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all\\nthat time he never set flipper on dry ground.\\n\\nOne day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water\\nsomewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all\\nover, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he\\nremembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles\\naway, the games his companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the\\nseal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming\\nsteadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for\\nthe same place, and they said: \"Greeting, Kotick! This year we are\\nall holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off\\nLukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?\"\\n\\nKotick\\'s fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of\\nit, he only said, \"Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land.\" And\\nso they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the\\nold seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.\\n\\nThat night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea\\nis full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to\\nLukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a\\nflaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent\\nstreaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds\\nand rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what\\nthey had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific\\nas boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if\\nanyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart\\nof that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie\\nromped down from Hutchinson\\'s Hill crying: \"Out of the way, youngsters!\\nThe sea is deep and you don\\'t know all that\\'s in it yet. Wait till\\nyou\\'ve rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white\\ncoat?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t get it,\" said Kotick. \"It grew.\" And just as he was going to\\nroll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces\\ncame from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man\\nbefore, coughed and lowered his head. The holluschickie just bundled off\\na few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick\\nBooterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon,\\nhis son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea\\nnurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the\\nkilling pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned\\ninto seal-skin jackets later on.\\n\\n\"Ho!\" said Patalamon. \"Look! There\\'s a white seal!\"\\n\\nKerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was\\nan Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a\\nprayer. \"Don\\'t touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal\\nsince--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof\\'s ghost. He was lost\\nlast year in the big gale.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going near him,\" said Patalamon. \"He\\'s unlucky. Do you really\\nthink he is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him for some gulls\\' eggs.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t look at him,\" said Kerick. \"Head off that drove of\\nfour-year-olds. The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it\\'s the\\nbeginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do.\\nQuick!\"\\n\\nPatalamon rattled a pair of seal\\'s shoulder bones in front of a herd\\nof holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he\\nstepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland,\\nand they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and\\nhundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went\\non playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions,\\nand none of his companions could tell him anything, except that the\\nmen always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every\\nyear.\\n\\n\"I am going to follow,\" he said, and his eyes nearly popped out of his\\nhead as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd.\\n\\n\"The white seal is coming after us,\" cried Patalamon. \"That\\'s the first\\ntime a seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone.\"\\n\\n\"Hsh! Don\\'t look behind you,\" said Kerick. \"It is Zaharrof\\'s ghost! I\\nmust speak to the priest about this.\"\\n\\nThe distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an\\nhour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they\\nwould get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they\\nwere skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion\\'s Neck, past\\nWebster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight\\nof the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering.\\nHe thought that he was at the world\\'s end, but the roar of the seal\\nnurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel.\\nThen Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch\\nand let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the\\nfog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each\\nwith an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick\\npointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions\\nor too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made\\nof the skin of a walrus\\'s throat, and then Kerick said, \"Let go!\" and\\nthen the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.\\n\\nTen minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more,\\nfor their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers,\\nwhipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough\\nfor Kotick. He turned and galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for\\na short time) back to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with\\nhorror. At Sea Lion\\'s Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge\\nof the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and\\nrocked there, gasping miserably. \"What\\'s here?\" said a sea lion gruffly,\\nfor as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.\\n\\n\"Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!\" (\"I\\'m lonesome, very lonesome!\") said\\nKotick. \"They\\'re killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!\"\\n\\nThe Sea Lion turned his head inshore. \"Nonsense!\" he said. \"Your\\nfriends are making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick\\npolishing off a drove. He\\'s done that for thirty years.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s horrible,\" said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and\\nsteadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him\\nall standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.\\n\\n\"Well done for a yearling!\" said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good\\nswimming. \"I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it,\\nbut if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get\\nto know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come\\nyou will always be driven.\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t there any such island?\" began Kotick.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I can\\'t\\nsay I\\'ve found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a fondness for\\ntalking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to\\nSea Vitch. He may know something. Don\\'t flounce off like that. It\\'s a\\nsix-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first,\\nlittle one.\"\\n\\nKotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own\\nbeach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as\\nseals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet\\nof rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and\\nrock and gulls\\' nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.\\n\\nHe landed close to old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled,\\nfat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners\\nexcept when he is asleep--as he was then, with his hind flippers half in\\nand half out of the surf.\\n\\n\"Wake up!\" barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.\\n\\n\"Hah! Ho! Hmph! What\\'s that?\" said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next\\nwalrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the\\nnext, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction\\nbut the right one.\\n\\n\"Hi! It\\'s me,\" said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a\\nlittle white slug.\\n\\n\"Well! May I be--skinned!\" said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick\\nas you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a\\nlittle boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just\\nthen; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: \"Isn\\'t there any place\\nfor seals to go where men don\\'t ever come?\"\\n\\n\"Go and find out,\" said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. \"Run away. We\\'re\\nbusy here.\"\\n\\nKotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could:\\n\"Clam-eater! Clam-eater!\" He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in\\nhis life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to\\nbe a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies\\nand the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the\\nPuffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the\\ncry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not\\nhave heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling\\nand screaming \"Clam-eater! Stareek [old man]!\" while Sea Vitch rolled\\nfrom side to side grunting and coughing.\\n\\n\"Now will you tell?\" said Kotick, all out of breath.\\n\\n\"Go and ask Sea Cow,\" said Sea Vitch. \"If he is living still, he\\'ll be\\nable to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"How shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him?\" said Kotick, sheering off.\\n\\n\"He\\'s the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch,\" screamed a\\nBurgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch\\'s nose. \"Uglier, and with\\nworse manners! Stareek!\"\\n\\nKotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he\\nfound that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover\\na quiet place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven\\nthe holluschickie--it was part of the day\\'s work--and that if he did not\\nlike to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds.\\nBut none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the\\ndifference between him and his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white\\nseal.\\n\\n\"What you must do,\" said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his son\\'s\\nadventures, \"is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have\\na nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another\\nfive years you ought to be able to fight for yourself.\" Even gentle\\nMatkah, his mother, said: \"You will never be able to stop the killing.\\nGo and play in the sea, Kotick.\" And Kotick went off and danced the\\nFire-dance with a very heavy little heart.\\n\\nThat autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone\\nbecause of a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow,\\nif there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet\\nisland with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not\\nget at them. So he explored and explored by himself from the North to\\nthe South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day\\nand a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly\\nescaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and\\nthe Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up\\nand down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted\\nscallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow\\nvery proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island\\nthat he could fancy.\\n\\nIf the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play\\non, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down\\nblubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that\\nseals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew\\nthat where men had come once they would come again.\\n\\nHe picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that\\nKerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick\\nwent down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked\\nblack cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as\\nhe pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once\\nbeen a seal nursery. And it was so in all the other islands that he\\nvisited.\\n\\nLimmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five\\nseasons exploring, with a four months\\' rest each year at Novastoshnah,\\nwhen the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary\\nislands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator,\\nwhere he was nearly baked to death; he went to the Georgia Islands,\\nthe Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough\\'s Island,\\nBouvet\\'s Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island\\nsouth of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the People of the Sea\\ntold him the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a\\ntime, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of\\nmiles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that\\nwas when he was coming back from Gough\\'s Island), he found a few hundred\\nmangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.\\n\\nThat nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his\\nown beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of\\ngreen trees, where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick\\ncaught fish for him and told him all his sorrows. \"Now,\" said Kotick,\\n\"I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens\\nwith the holluschickie I shall not care.\"\\n\\nThe old seal said, \"Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of\\nMasafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand\\nthere was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come\\nout of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old,\\nand I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more.\"\\n\\nAnd Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, \"I am the\\nonly white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the\\nonly seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.\"\\n\\nThis cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that\\nsummer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for\\nhe was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly\\nwhite mane on his shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his\\nfather. \"Give me another season,\" he said. \"Remember, Mother, it is\\nalways the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.\"\\n\\nCuriously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put\\noff marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with\\nher all down Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last\\nexploration. This time he went westward, because he had fallen on the\\ntrail of a great shoal of halibut, and he needed at least one hundred\\npounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition. He chased them till\\nhe was tired, and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the\\nhollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the\\ncoast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently\\nbumped on a weed-bed, he said, \"Hm, tide\\'s running strong tonight,\" and\\nturning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched. Then\\nhe jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal\\nwater and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.\\n\\n\"By the Great Combers of Magellan!\" he said, beneath his mustache. \"Who\\nin the Deep Sea are these people?\"\\n\\nThey were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish,\\nsquid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between\\ntwenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a\\nshovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet\\nleather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw,\\nand they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they\\nweren\\'t grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front\\nflippers as a fat man waves his arm.\\n\\n\"Ahem!\" said Kotick. \"Good sport, gentlemen?\" The big things answered by\\nbowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began\\nfeeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces\\nthat they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with\\na whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into\\ntheir mouths and chumped solemnly.\\n\\n\"Messy style of feeding, that,\" said Kotick. They bowed again, and\\nKotick began to lose his temper. \"Very good,\" he said. \"If you do happen\\nto have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn\\'t show off so. I\\nsee you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.\" The split\\nlips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did\\nnot speak.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Kotick. \"You\\'re the only people I\\'ve ever met uglier than\\nSea Vitch--and with worse manners.\"\\n\\nThen he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed\\nto him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled\\nbackward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.\\n\\nThe sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed,\\nand Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked\\nup in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as\\nhuman beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot\\ntalk. He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven,\\nand they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even\\nto his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his\\nforeflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what\\nanswers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.\\n\\nBy daylight Kotick\\'s mane was standing on end and his temper was gone\\nwhere the dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very\\nslowly, stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and\\nKotick followed them, saying to himself, \"People who are such idiots as\\nthese are would have been killed long ago if they hadn\\'t found out some\\nsafe island. And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for\\nthe Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they\\'d hurry.\"\\n\\nIt was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or\\nfifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the\\nshore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and\\nunder them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went\\nfarther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick\\nnearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were\\nfollowing up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more.\\n\\nOne night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for\\nthe first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick\\nfollowed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow\\nwas anything of a swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff\\nthat ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the\\nfoot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and\\nKotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they\\nled him through.\\n\\n\"My wig!\" he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at\\nthe farther end. \"It was a long dive, but it was worth it.\"\\n\\nThe sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of\\nthe finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long\\nstretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make\\nseal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland\\nbehind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long\\ngrass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all,\\nKotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea\\ncatch, that no men had ever come there.\\n\\nThe first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good,\\nand then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low\\nsandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the\\nnorthward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that\\nwould never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between\\nthe islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to\\nthe perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth\\nof the tunnel.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,\" said Kotick. \"Sea\\nCow must be wiser than I thought. Men can\\'t come down the cliffs, even\\nif there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to\\nsplinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.\"\\n\\nHe began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was\\nin a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new\\ncountry, so that he would be able to answer all questions.\\n\\nThen he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced\\nthrough to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have\\ndreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the\\ncliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them.\\n\\nHe was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when\\nhe hauled out just above Sea Lion\\'s Neck the first person he met was the\\nseal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes\\nthat he had found his island at last.\\n\\nBut the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals\\nlaughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young\\nseal about his own age said, \"This is all very well, Kotick, but you\\ncan\\'t come from no one knows where and order us off like this. Remember\\nwe\\'ve been fighting for our nurseries, and that\\'s a thing you never did.\\nYou preferred prowling about in the sea.\"\\n\\nThe other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his\\nhead from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a\\ngreat fuss about it.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no nursery to fight for,\" said Kotick. \"I only want to show you\\nall a place where you will be safe. What\\'s the use of fighting?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if you\\'re trying to back out, of course I\\'ve no more to say,\" said\\nthe young seal with an ugly chuckle.\\n\\n\"Will you come with me if I win?\" said Kotick. And a green light came\\ninto his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.\\n\\n\"Very good,\" said the young seal carelessly. \"If you win, I\\'ll come.\"\\n\\nHe had no time to change his mind, for Kotick\\'s head was out and his\\nteeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal\\'s neck. Then he threw\\nhimself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook\\nhim, and knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: \"I\\'ve done\\nmy best for you these five seasons past. I\\'ve found you the island where\\nyou\\'ll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks\\nyou won\\'t believe. I\\'m going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!\"\\n\\nLimmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin sees ten\\nthousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his little life\\ndid he see anything like Kotick\\'s charge into the nurseries. He flung\\nhimself at the biggest sea catch he could find, caught him by the\\nthroat, choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for\\nmercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick\\nhad never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and\\nhis deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best\\nof all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane stood up with\\nrage, and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was\\nsplendid to look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past,\\nhauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut,\\nand upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave\\na roar and shouted: \"He may be a fool, but he is the best fighter on the\\nbeaches! Don\\'t tackle your father, my son! He\\'s with you!\"\\n\\nKotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache\\non end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was\\ngoing to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was\\na gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that\\ndared lift up his head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up\\nand down the beach side by side, bellowing.\\n\\nAt night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through\\nthe fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered\\nnurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. \"Now,\" he said, \"I\\'ve taught\\nyou your lesson.\"\\n\\n\"My wig!\" said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was\\nfearfully mauled. \"The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up\\nworse. Son, I\\'m proud of you, and what\\'s more, I\\'ll come with you to\\nyour island--if there is such a place.\"\\n\\n\"Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow\\'s\\ntunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,\" roared Kotick.\\n\\nThere was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the\\nbeaches. \"We will come,\" said thousands of tired voices. \"We will follow\\nKotick, the White Seal.\"\\n\\nThen Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes\\nproudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail.\\nAll the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his\\nwounds.\\n\\nA week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old\\nseals) went away north to the Sea Cow\\'s tunnel, Kotick leading them,\\nand the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next\\nspring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick\\'s\\nseals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow\\'s tunnel that\\nmore and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at\\nonce, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to\\nturn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went\\naway from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the\\nquiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through,\\ngetting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the\\nholluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLukannon\\n\\nThis is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when\\nthey are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of\\nvery sad seal National Anthem.\\n\\n     I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)\\n     Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;\\n     I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers\\' song--\\n     The Beaches of Lukannon--two million voices strong.\\n\\n     The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,\\n     The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,\\n     The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame--\\n     The Beaches of Lukannon--before the sealers came!\\n\\n     I met my mates in the morning (I\\'ll never meet them more!);\\n     They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.\\n     And o\\'er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach\\n     We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.\\n\\n     The Beaches of Lukannon--the winter wheat so tall--\\n     The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!\\n     The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!\\n     The Beaches of Lukannon--the home where we were born!\\n\\n     I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.\\n     Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;\\n     Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,\\n     And still we sing Lukannon--before the sealers came.\\n\\n     Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!\\n     And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;\\n     Ere, empty as the shark\\'s egg the tempest flings ashore,\\n     The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\"\\n\\n     At the hole where he went in\\n     Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.\\n     Hear what little Red-Eye saith:\\n     \"Nag, come up and dance with death!\"\\n\\n     Eye to eye and head to head,\\n        (Keep the measure, Nag.)\\n     This shall end when one is dead;\\n        (At thy pleasure, Nag.)\\n     Turn for turn and twist for twist--\\n        (Run and hide thee, Nag.)\\n     Hah!  The hooded Death has missed!\\n        (Woe betide thee, Nag!)\\n\\nThis is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought\\nsingle-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee\\ncantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the\\nmusk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always\\ncreeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real\\nfighting.\\n\\nHe was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but\\nquite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end\\nof his restless nose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he\\npleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could\\nfluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as\\nhe scuttled through the long grass was: \"Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!\"\\n\\nOne day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived\\nwith his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down\\na roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and\\nclung to it till he lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in\\nthe hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a\\nsmall boy was saying, \"Here\\'s a dead mongoose. Let\\'s have a funeral.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said his mother, \"let\\'s take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn\\'t\\nreally dead.\"\\n\\nThey took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his\\nfinger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they\\nwrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he\\nopened his eyes and sneezed.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into\\nthe bungalow), \"don\\'t frighten him, and we\\'ll see what he\\'ll do.\"\\n\\nIt is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because\\nhe is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all\\nthe mongoose family is \"Run and find out,\" and Rikki-tikki was a true\\nmongoose. He looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to\\neat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched\\nhimself, and jumped on the small boy\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened, Teddy,\" said his father. \"That\\'s his way of making\\nfriends.\"\\n\\n\"Ouch! He\\'s tickling under my chin,\" said Teddy.\\n\\nRikki-tikki looked down between the boy\\'s collar and neck, snuffed at\\nhis ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.\\n\\n\"Good gracious,\" said Teddy\\'s mother, \"and that\\'s a wild creature! I\\nsuppose he\\'s so tame because we\\'ve been kind to him.\"\\n\\n\"All mongooses are like that,\" said her husband. \"If Teddy doesn\\'t pick\\nhim up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he\\'ll run in and out of\\nthe house all day long. Let\\'s give him something to eat.\"\\n\\nThey gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it\\nimmensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat\\nin the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then\\nhe felt better.\\n\\n\"There are more things to find out about in this house,\" he said to\\nhimself, \"than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall\\ncertainly stay and find out.\"\\n\\nHe spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself\\nin the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and\\nburned it on the end of the big man\\'s cigar, for he climbed up in the\\nbig man\\'s lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into\\nTeddy\\'s nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy\\nwent to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion,\\nbecause he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the\\nnight, and find out what made it. Teddy\\'s mother and father came in,\\nthe last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on\\nthe pillow. \"I don\\'t like that,\" said Teddy\\'s mother. \"He may bite the\\nchild.\" \"He\\'ll do no such thing,\" said the father. \"Teddy\\'s safer with\\nthat little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake\\ncame into the nursery now--\"\\n\\nBut Teddy\\'s mother wouldn\\'t think of anything so awful.\\n\\nEarly in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda\\nriding on Teddy\\'s shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled\\negg. He sat on all their laps one after the other, because every\\nwell-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day\\nand have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikki\\'s mother (she used to\\nlive in the general\\'s house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what\\nto do if ever he came across white men.\\n\\nThen Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen.\\nIt was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as\\nsummer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of\\nbamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. \"This\\nis a splendid hunting-ground,\" he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy\\nat the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing\\nhere and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush.\\n\\nIt was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful\\nnest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges\\nwith fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The\\nnest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Rikki-tikki.\\n\\n\"We are very miserable,\" said Darzee. \"One of our babies fell out of the\\nnest yesterday and Nag ate him.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" said Rikki-tikki, \"that is very sad--but I am a stranger here.\\nWho is Nag?\"\\n\\nDarzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for\\nfrom the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss--a\\nhorrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then\\ninch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag,\\nthe big black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.\\nWhen he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed\\nbalancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind,\\nand he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake\\'s eyes that never\\nchange their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.\\n\\n\"Who is Nag?\" said he. \"I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon\\nall our people, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off\\nBrahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!\"\\n\\nHe spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the\\nspectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part\\nof a hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute, but it is\\nimpossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and\\nthough Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother had fed\\nhim on dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose\\'s business in\\nlife was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom\\nof his cold heart, he was afraid.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, \"marks\\nor no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a\\nnest?\"\\n\\nNag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in\\nthe grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden\\nmeant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get\\nRikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it\\non one side.\\n\\n\"Let us talk,\" he said. \"You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?\"\\n\\n\"Behind you! Look behind you!\" sang Darzee.\\n\\nRikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up in\\nthe air as high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the head\\nof Nagaina, Nag\\'s wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he was\\ntalking, to make an end of him. He heard her savage hiss as the stroke\\nmissed. He came down almost across her back, and if he had been an old\\nmongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back\\nwith one bite; but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke\\nof the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite long enough, and he\\njumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and angry.\\n\\n\"Wicked, wicked Darzee!\" said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach\\ntoward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach\\nof snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.\\n\\nRikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose\\'s eyes\\ngrow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a\\nlittle kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But\\nNag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its\\nstroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do\\nnext. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure\\nthat he could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel\\npath near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for\\nhim.\\n\\nIf you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say\\nthat when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten,\\nhe runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true.\\nThe victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of\\nfoot--snake\\'s blow against mongoose\\'s jump--and as no eye can follow the\\nmotion of a snake\\'s head when it strikes, this makes things much more\\nwonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose,\\nand it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to\\nescape a blow from behind. It gave him confidence in himself, and when\\nTeddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.\\n\\nBut just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust,\\nand a tiny voice said: \"Be careful. I am Death!\" It was Karait, the\\ndusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his\\nbite is as dangerous as the cobra\\'s. But he is so small that nobody\\nthinks of him, and so he does the more harm to people.\\n\\nRikki-tikki\\'s eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the\\npeculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family.\\nIt looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can\\nfly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this\\nis an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more\\ndangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn\\nso quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to the back of the head,\\nhe would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not\\nknow. His eyes were all red, and he rocked back and forth, looking for\\na good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and\\ntried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a\\nfraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head\\nfollowed his heels close.\\n\\nTeddy shouted to the house: \"Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a\\nsnake.\" And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy\\'s mother. His father\\nran out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out\\nonce too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake\\'s back,\\ndropped his head far between his forelegs, bitten as high up the back\\nas he could get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and\\nRikki-tikki was just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom\\nof his family at dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a\\nslow mongoose, and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he\\nmust keep himself thin.\\n\\nHe went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while\\nTeddy\\'s father beat the dead Karait. \"What is the use of that?\" thought\\nRikki-tikki. \"I have settled it all;\" and then Teddy\\'s mother picked\\nhim up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved Teddy\\nfrom death, and Teddy\\'s father said that he was a providence, and Teddy\\nlooked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the\\nfuss, which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy\\'s mother might just\\nas well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was thoroughly\\nenjoying himself.\\n\\nThat night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the\\ntable, he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things.\\nBut he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be\\npatted and petted by Teddy\\'s mother, and to sit on Teddy\\'s shoulder, his\\neyes would get red from time to time, and he would go off into his long\\nwar cry of \"Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!\"\\n\\nTeddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under\\nhis chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon\\nas Teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house,\\nand in the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the musk-rat, creeping\\naround by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He\\nwhimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up his mind to run\\ninto the middle of the room. But he never gets there.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t kill me,\" said Chuchundra, almost weeping. \"Rikki-tikki, don\\'t\\nkill me!\"\\n\\n\"Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?\" said Rikki-tikki\\nscornfully.\\n\\n\"Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,\" said Chuchundra, more\\nsorrowfully than ever. \"And how am I to be sure that Nag won\\'t mistake\\nme for you some dark night?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s not the least danger,\" said Rikki-tikki. \"But Nag is in the\\ngarden, and I know you don\\'t go there.\"\\n\\n\"My cousin Chua, the rat, told me--\" said Chuchundra, and then he\\nstopped.\\n\\n\"Told you what?\"\\n\\n\"H\\'sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in\\nthe garden.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I\\'ll bite you!\"\\n\\nChuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers.\\n\"I am a very poor man,\" he sobbed. \"I never had spirit enough to run out\\ninto the middle of the room. H\\'sh! I mustn\\'t tell you anything. Can\\'t\\nyou hear, Rikki-tikki?\"\\n\\nRikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he\\ncould just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as\\nfaint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a\\nsnake\\'s scales on brick-work.\\n\\n\"That\\'s Nag or Nagaina,\" he said to himself, \"and he is crawling into\\nthe bath-room sluice. You\\'re right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to\\nChua.\"\\n\\nHe stole off to Teddy\\'s bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then\\nto Teddy\\'s mother\\'s bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall\\nthere was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as\\nRikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he heard\\nNag and Nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight.\\n\\n\"When the house is emptied of people,\" said Nagaina to her husband, \"he\\nwill have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in\\nquietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first\\none to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki\\ntogether.\"\\n\\n\"But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the\\npeople?\" said Nag.\\n\\n\"Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any\\nmongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king\\nand queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the\\nmelon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and\\nquiet.\"\\n\\n\"I had not thought of that,\" said Nag. \"I will go, but there is no need\\nthat we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man\\nand his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the\\nbungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.\"\\n\\nRikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then\\nNag\\'s head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body\\nfollowed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw\\nthe size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head,\\nand looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his eyes\\nglitter.\\n\\n\"Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on\\nthe open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?\" said\\nRikki-tikki-tavi.\\n\\nNag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the\\nbiggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. \"That is good,\" said\\nthe snake. \"Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may\\nhave that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he\\nwill not have a stick. I shall wait here till he comes. Nagaina--do you\\nhear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till daytime.\"\\n\\nThere was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone\\naway. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the\\nbottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an\\nhour he began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep,\\nand Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which would be the\\nbest place for a good hold. \"If I don\\'t break his back at the first\\njump,\" said Rikki, \"he can still fight. And if he fights--O Rikki!\" He\\nlooked at the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too\\nmuch for him; and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.\\n\\n\"It must be the head\"\\' he said at last; \"the head above the hood. And,\\nwhen I am once there, I must not let go.\"\\n\\nThen he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar,\\nunder the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back\\nagainst the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head. This\\ngave him just one second\\'s purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he\\nwas battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the\\nfloor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his eyes were red\\nand he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the\\ntin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and banged against the\\ntin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter,\\nfor he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his\\nfamily, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy,\\naching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a\\nthunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red\\nfire singed his fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had\\nfired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood.\\n\\nRikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was\\ndead. But the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said,\\n\"It\\'s the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives\\nnow.\"\\n\\nThen Teddy\\'s mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was\\nleft of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy\\'s bedroom and\\nspent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out\\nwhether he really was broken into forty pieces, as he fancied.\\n\\nWhen morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings.\\n\"Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five\\nNags, and there\\'s no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch.\\nGoodness! I must go and see Darzee,\" he said.\\n\\nWithout waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where\\nDarzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice. The news\\nof Nag\\'s death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the\\nbody on the rubbish-heap.\\n\\n\"Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!\" said Rikki-tikki angrily. \"Is this\\nthe time to sing?\"\\n\\n\"Nag is dead--is dead--is dead!\" sang Darzee. \"The valiant Rikki-tikki\\ncaught him by the head and held fast. The big man brought the\\nbang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my babies\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"All that\\'s true enough. But where\\'s Nagaina?\" said Rikki-tikki, looking\\ncarefully round him.\\n\\n\"Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,\" Darzee went\\non, \"and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him up\\non the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing\\nabout the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!\" And Darzee filled his throat\\nand sang.\\n\\n\"If I could get up to your nest, I\\'d roll your babies out!\" said\\nRikki-tikki. \"You don\\'t know when to do the right thing at the right\\ntime. You\\'re safe enough in your nest there, but it\\'s war for me down\\nhere. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.\"\\n\\n\"For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki\\'s sake I will stop,\" said\\nDarzee. \"What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?\"\\n\\n\"Where is Nagaina, for the third time?\"\\n\\n\"On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is\\nRikki-tikki with the white teeth.\"\\n\\n\"Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?\"\\n\\n\"In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes\\nnearly all day. She hid them there weeks ago.\"\\n\\n\"And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the\\nwall, you said?\"\\n\\n\"Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?\"\\n\\n\"Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly\\noff to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina\\nchase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went\\nthere now she\\'d see me.\"\\n\\nDarzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more\\nthan one idea at a time in his head. And just because he knew that\\nNagaina\\'s children were born in eggs like his own, he didn\\'t think at\\nfirst that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible bird,\\nand she knew that cobra\\'s eggs meant young cobras later on. So she flew\\noff from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue\\nhis song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some\\nways.\\n\\nShe fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out,\\n\"Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and\\nbroke it.\" Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.\\n\\nNagaina lifted up her head and hissed, \"You warned Rikki-tikki when I\\nwould have killed him. Indeed and truly, you\\'ve chosen a bad place to\\nbe lame in.\" And she moved toward Darzee\\'s wife, slipping along over the\\ndust.\\n\\n\"The boy broke it with a stone!\" shrieked Darzee\\'s wife.\\n\\n\"Well! It may be some consolation to you when you\\'re dead to know that I\\nshall settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the rubbish heap\\nthis morning, but before night the boy in the house will lie very still.\\nWhat is the use of running away? I am sure to catch you. Little fool,\\nlook at me!\"\\n\\nDarzee\\'s wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a\\nsnake\\'s eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee\\'s wife\\nfluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and\\nNagaina quickened her pace.\\n\\nRikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced\\nfor the end of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter\\nabove the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs,\\nabout the size of a bantam\\'s eggs, but with whitish skin instead of\\nshell.\\n\\n\"I was not a day too soon,\" he said, for he could see the baby cobras\\ncurled up inside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were hatched\\nthey could each kill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops of the\\neggs as fast as he could, taking care to crush the young cobras, and\\nturned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed\\nany. At last there were only three eggs left, and Rikki-tikki began to\\nchuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee\\'s wife screaming:\\n\\n\"Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the\\nveranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!\"\\n\\nRikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed\\nwith the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as\\nhe could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were\\nthere at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating\\nanything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was\\ncoiled up on the matting by Teddy\\'s chair, within easy striking distance\\nof Teddy\\'s bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of\\ntriumph.\\n\\n\"Son of the big man that killed Nag,\" she hissed, \"stay still. I am not\\nready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I\\nstrike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed\\nmy Nag!\"\\n\\nTeddy\\'s eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was\\nto whisper, \"Sit still, Teddy. You mustn\\'t move. Teddy, keep still.\"\\n\\nThen Rikki-tikki came up and cried, \"Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and\\nfight!\"\\n\\n\"All in good time,\" said she, without moving her eyes. \"I will settle my\\naccount with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are\\nstill and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a\\nstep nearer I strike.\"\\n\\n\"Look at your eggs,\" said Rikki-tikki, \"in the melon bed near the wall.\\nGo and look, Nagaina!\"\\n\\nThe big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. \"Ah-h!\\nGive it to me,\" she said.\\n\\nRikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were\\nblood-red. \"What price for a snake\\'s egg? For a young cobra? For a\\nyoung king cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The ants are\\neating all the others down by the melon bed.\"\\n\\nNagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one\\negg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy\\'s father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy\\nby the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups,\\nsafe and out of reach of Nagaina.\\n\\n\"Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!\" chuckled Rikki-tikki. \"The\\nboy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last night\\nin the bathroom.\" Then he began to jump up and down, all four feet\\ntogether, his head close to the floor. \"He threw me to and fro, but he\\ncould not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew him in two.\\nI did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with\\nme. You shall not be a widow long.\"\\n\\nNagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg\\nlay between Rikki-tikki\\'s paws. \"Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me\\nthe last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,\" she said,\\nlowering her hood.\\n\\n\"Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go\\nto the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his\\ngun! Fight!\"\\n\\nRikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach\\nof her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself\\ntogether and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again\\nand again and again she struck, and each time her head came with a whack\\non the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a\\nwatch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her, and\\nNagaina spun round to keep her head to his head, so that the rustle of\\nher tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.\\n\\nHe had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came\\nnearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing\\nbreath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and\\nflew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When\\nthe cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a\\nhorse\\'s neck.\\n\\nRikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin\\nagain. She headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as\\nhe was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little\\nsong of triumph. But Darzee\\'s wife was wiser. She flew off her nest\\nas Nagaina came along, and flapped her wings about Nagaina\\'s head. If\\nDarzee had helped they might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered\\nher hood and went on. Still, the instant\\'s delay brought Rikki-tikki up\\nto her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to\\nlive, his little white teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down\\nwith her--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be,\\ncare to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and\\nRikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to\\nturn and strike at him. He held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to\\nact as brakes on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth.\\n\\nThen the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,\\n\"It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant\\nRikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.\"\\n\\nSo he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the\\nminute, and just as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered\\nagain, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the\\nhole leg by leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little\\nshout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed.\\n\"It is all over,\" he said. \"The widow will never come out again.\" And\\nthe red ants that live between the grass stems heard him, and began to\\ntroop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth.\\n\\nRikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was--slept\\nand slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard\\nday\\'s work.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he said, when he awoke, \"I will go back to the house. Tell the\\nCoppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.\"\\n\\nThe Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of\\na little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always making it\\nis because he is the town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all\\nthe news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the\\npath, he heard his \"attention\" notes like a tiny dinner gong, and\\nthen the steady \"Ding-dong-tock! Nag is dead--dong! Nagaina is dead!\\nDing-dong-tock!\" That set all the birds in the garden singing, and the\\nfrogs croaking, for Nag and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little\\nbirds.\\n\\nWhen Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy\\'s mother (she looked very\\nwhite still, for she had been fainting) and Teddy\\'s father came out and\\nalmost cried over him; and that night he ate all that was given him till\\nhe could eat no more, and went to bed on Teddy\\'s shoulder, where Teddy\\'s\\nmother saw him when she came to look late at night.\\n\\n\"He saved our lives and Teddy\\'s life,\" she said to her husband. \"Just\\nthink, he saved all our lives.\"\\n\\nRikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you,\" said he. \"What are you bothering for? All the cobras are\\ndead. And if they weren\\'t, I\\'m here.\"\\n\\nRikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he did not grow too\\nproud, and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth\\nand jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head\\ninside the walls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDarzee\\'s Chant\\n\\n     (Sung in honor of Rikki-tikki-tavi)\\n\\n     Singer and tailor am I--\\n        Doubled the joys that I know--\\n     Proud of my lilt to the sky,\\n        Proud of the house that I sew--\\n     Over and under, so weave I my music--so weave I the house that I\\n        sew.\\n\\n     Sing to your fledglings again,\\n        Mother, oh lift up your head!\\n     Evil that plagued us is slain,\\n        Death in the garden lies dead.\\n     Terror that hid in the roses is impotent--flung on the dung-hill\\n     and dead!\\n\\n     Who has delivered us, who?\\n        Tell me his nest and his name.\\n     Rikki, the valiant, the true,\\n        Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,\\n     Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of\\n     flame!\\n\\n     Give him the Thanks of the Birds,\\n        Bowing with tail feathers spread!\\n     Praise him with nightingale words--\\n        Nay, I will praise him instead.\\n     Hear!

He remembered pushing, with a big\\nleather pad on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was\\nbefore the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full\\nstrength.\\n\\nHis mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had been caught in the\\nsame drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had\\ndropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag\\nknew that that advice was good, for the first time that he saw a shell\\nburst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the\\nbayonets pricked him in all his softest places. So, before he was\\ntwenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved\\nand the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of\\nIndia. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds\\' weight of tents, on\\nthe march in Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of\\na steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a\\nmortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India,\\nand had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had\\ncome back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the\\nAbyssinian War medal. He had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and\\nepilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid,\\nten years later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles\\nsouth to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein.\\nThere he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was\\nshirking his fair share of work.\\n\\nAfter that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few\\nscore other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to\\ncatch wild elephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly\\npreserved by the Indian Government. There is one whole department which\\ndoes nothing else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and\\nsend them up and down the country as they are needed for work.\\n\\nKala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been\\ncut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them\\nsplitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps\\nthan any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When,\\nafter weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across\\nthe hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last\\nstockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together,\\njarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go\\ninto that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when\\nthe flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances), and,\\npicking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer\\nhim and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other\\nelephants roped and tied the smaller ones.\\n\\nThere was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise\\nBlack Snake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his\\ntime to the charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk\\nto be out of harm\\'s way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in\\nmid-air with a quick sickle cut of his head, that he had invented all by\\nhimself; had knocked him over, and kneeled upon him with his huge knees\\ntill the life went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a\\nfluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had\\ntaken him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had\\nseen him caught, \"there is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me.\\nHe has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him, and he will\\nlive to see four.\"\\n\\n\"He is afraid of me also,\" said Little Toomai, standing up to his full\\nheight of four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old,\\nthe eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take\\nhis father\\'s place on Kala Nag\\'s neck when he grew up, and would handle\\nthe heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by\\nhis father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.\\n\\nHe knew what he was talking of; for he had been born under Kala Nag\\'s\\nshadow, had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk, had\\ntaken him down to water as soon as he could walk, and Kala Nag would no\\nmore have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would\\nhave dreamed of killing him on that day when Big Toomai carried the\\nlittle brown baby under Kala Nag\\'s tusks, and told him to salute his\\nmaster that was to be.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Little Toomai, \"he is afraid of me,\" and he took long\\nstrides up to Kala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up\\nhis feet one after the other.\\n\\n\"Wah!\" said Little Toomai, \"thou art a big elephant,\" and he wagged his\\nfluffy head, quoting his father. \"The Government may pay for elephants,\\nbut they belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will\\ncome some rich rajah, and he will buy thee from the Government, on\\naccount of thy size and thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing\\nto do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a gold howdah on thy\\nback, and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides, and walk at the\\nhead of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit on thy neck, O\\nKala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us with golden\\nsticks, crying, `Room for the King\\'s elephant!\\' That will be good, Kala\\nNag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles.\"\\n\\n\"Umph!\" said Big Toomai. \"Thou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf.\\nThis running up and down among the hills is not the best Government\\nservice. I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me\\nbrick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie\\nthem to safely, and flat, broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this\\ncome-and-go camping. Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good. There was a\\nbazaar close by, and only three hours\\' work a day.\"\\n\\nLittle Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing.\\nHe very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads,\\nwith the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long\\nhours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in\\nhis pickets.\\n\\nWhat Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an\\nelephant could take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the\\nwild elephants browsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and\\npeacock under Kala Nag\\'s feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the\\nhills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew\\nwhere they would camp that night; the steady, cautious drive of the wild\\nelephants, and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night\\'s\\ndrive, when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a\\nlandslide, found that they could not get out, and flung themselves at\\nthe heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and\\nvolleys of blank cartridge.\\n\\nEven a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as\\nthree boys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the\\nbest. But the really good time came when the driving out began, and the\\nKeddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of the end of the\\nworld, and men had to make signs to one another, because they could not\\nhear themselves speak. Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top of\\none of the quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown hair flying\\nloose all over his shoulders, and he looking like a goblin in the\\ntorch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could hear his\\nhigh-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting\\nand crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered\\nelephants. \"Mael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do!\\n(Give him the tusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!) Maro! Mar! (Hit\\nhim, hit him!) Mind the post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!\" he would\\nshout, and the big fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would\\nsway to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant catchers would\\nwipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find time to nod to Little Toomai\\nwriggling with joy on the top of the posts.\\n\\nHe did more than wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and\\nslipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope,\\nwhich had dropped, to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on\\nthe leg of a kicking young calf (calves always give more trouble than\\nfull-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught him in his trunk, and\\nhanded him up to Big Toomai, who slapped him then and there, and put him\\nback on the post.\\n\\nNext morning he gave him a scolding and said, \"Are not good brick\\nelephant lines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs\\ngo elephant catching on thy own account, little worthless? Now those\\nfoolish hunters, whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen\\nSahib of the matter.\" Little Toomai was frightened. He did not know much\\nof white men, but Petersen Sahib was the greatest white man in the world\\nto him. He was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man who caught\\nall the elephants for the Government of India, and who knew more about\\nthe ways of elephants than any living man.\\n\\n\"What--what will happen?\" said Little Toomai.\\n\\n\"Happen! The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why\\nshould he go hunting these wild devils? He may even require thee to be\\nan elephant catcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles,\\nand at last to be trampled to death in the Keddah. It is well that this\\nnonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is over, and we of the\\nplains are sent back to our stations. Then we will march on smooth\\nroads, and forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that thou\\nshouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty Assamese\\njungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with him into\\nthe Keddah, but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does not help\\nto rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere\\nhunter,--a mahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of\\nhis service. Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden\\nunderfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son!\\nGo and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see that there are no\\nthorns in his feet. Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and\\nmake thee a wild hunter--a follower of elephant\\'s foot tracks, a jungle\\nbear. Bah! Shame! Go!\"\\n\\nLittle Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all\\nhis grievances while he was examining his feet. \"No matter,\" said Little\\nToomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nag\\'s huge right ear. \"They\\nhave said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and perhaps--and\\nperhaps--who knows? Hai! That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!\"\\n\\nThe next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in\\nwalking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of\\ntame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march\\nto the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things\\nthat had been worn out or lost in the forest.\\n\\nPetersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been\\npaying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an\\nend, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to\\npay the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he went back to his\\nelephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers,\\nand hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in\\nthe jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that\\nbelonged to Petersen Sahib\\'s permanent force, or leaned against the\\ntrees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who\\nwere going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the\\nline and ran about.\\n\\nBig Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and\\nMachua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his,\\n\"There goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. \\'Tis a pity to\\nsend that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.\"\\n\\nNow Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens\\nto the most silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He turned\\nwhere he was lying all along on Pudmini\\'s back and said, \"What is that?\\nI did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to\\nrope even a dead elephant.\"\\n\\n\"This is not a man, but a boy. He went into the Keddah at the last\\ndrive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that\\nyoung calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.\"\\n\\nMachua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and\\nLittle Toomai bowed to the earth.\\n\\n\"He throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is\\nthy name?\" said Petersen Sahib.\\n\\nLittle Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him,\\nand Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in\\nhis trunk and held him level with Pudmini\\'s forehead, in front of the\\ngreat Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his\\nhands, for he was only a child, and except where elephants were\\nconcerned, he was just as bashful as a child could be.\\n\\n\"Oho!\" said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, \"and why\\ndidst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal\\ngreen corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to\\ndry?\"\\n\\n\"Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons,\" said Little Toomai,\\nand all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of\\nthem had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys. Little\\nToomai was hanging eight feet up in the air, and he wished very much\\nthat he were eight feet underground.\\n\\n\"He is Toomai, my son, Sahib,\" said Big Toomai, scowling. \"He is a very\\nbad boy, and he will end in a jail, Sahib.\"\\n\\n\"Of that I have my doubts,\" said Petersen Sahib. \"A boy who can face a\\nfull Keddah at his age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are\\nfour annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under\\nthat great thatch of hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter too.\" Big\\nToomai scowled more than ever. \"Remember, though, that Keddahs are not\\ngood for children to play in,\" Petersen Sahib went on.\\n\\n\"Must I never go there, Sahib?\" asked Little Toomai with a big gasp.\\n\\n\"Yes.\" Petersen Sahib smiled again. \"When thou hast seen the elephants\\ndance. That is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the\\nelephants dance, and then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs.\"\\n\\nThere was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among\\nelephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat\\nplaces hidden away in the forests that are called elephants\\' ball-rooms,\\nbut even these are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the\\nelephants dance. When a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other\\ndrivers say, \"And when didst thou see the elephants dance?\"\\n\\nKala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again and\\nwent away with his father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his\\nmother, who was nursing his baby brother, and they all were put up on\\nKala Nag\\'s back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled\\ndown the hill path to the plains. It was a very lively march on account\\nof the new elephants, who gave trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing\\nor beating every other minute.\\n\\nBig Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but\\nLittle Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him,\\nand given him money, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he\\nhad been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief.\\n\\n\"What did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?\" he said, at last,\\nsoftly to his mother.\\n\\nBig Toomai heard him and grunted. \"That thou shouldst never be one of\\nthese hill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he meant. Oh, you in\\nfront, what is blocking the way?\"\\n\\nAn Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily,\\ncrying: \"Bring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good\\nbehavior. Why should Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you\\ndonkeys of the rice fields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and\\nlet him prod with his tusks. By all the Gods of the Hills, these new\\nelephants are possessed, or else they can smell their companions in the\\njungle.\" Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the\\nwind out of him, as Big Toomai said, \"We have swept the hills of wild\\nelephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving.\\nMust I keep order along the whole line?\"\\n\\n\"Hear him!\" said the other driver. \"We have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You\\nare very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw\\nthe jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the\\nseason. Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I\\nwaste wisdom on a river-turtle?\"\\n\\n\"What will they do?\" Little Toomai called out.\\n\\n\"Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast\\na cool head. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has\\nswept all the hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets\\nto-night.\"\\n\\n\"What talk is this?\" said Big Toomai. \"For forty years, father and son,\\nwe have tended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about\\ndances.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls\\nof his hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what\\ncomes. As for their dancing, I have seen the place where--Bapree-bap!\\nHow many windings has the Dihang River? Here is another ford, and we\\nmust swim the calves. Stop still, you behind there.\"\\n\\nAnd in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers,\\nthey made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new\\nelephants. But they lost their tempers long before they got there.\\n\\nThen the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps\\nof pickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the\\nfodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen\\nSahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be\\nextra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the\\nreason.\\n\\nLittle Toomai attended to Kala Nag\\'s supper, and as evening fell,\\nwandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom.\\nWhen an Indian child\\'s heart is full, he does not run about and make a\\nnoise in an irregular fashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by\\nhimself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he\\nhad not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. But the\\nsweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten\\nwith the flat of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala\\nNag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he\\nthumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the\\ngreat honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone\\namong the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the\\nthumping made him happy.\\n\\nThe new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted\\nfrom time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting\\nhis small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God\\nShiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very\\nsoothing lullaby, and the first verse says:\\n\\n     Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,\\n     Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,\\n     Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,\\n     From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.\\n        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.\\n     Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all--\\n     Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,\\n     And mother\\'s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!\\n\\nLittle Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each\\nverse, till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala\\nNag\\'s side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another\\nas is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was\\nleft standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put\\nforward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the\\nhills. The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together,\\nmake one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the other,\\nthe rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk\\nof a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than\\nwe imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept\\nfor some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala\\nNag was still standing up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned,\\nrustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against\\nhalf the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away\\nthat it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the\\nstillness, the \"hoot-toot\" of a wild elephant.\\n\\nAll the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and\\ntheir grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and\\ndrove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and\\nknotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up\\nhis picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag\\'s leg chain and shackled\\nthat elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string\\nround Kala Nag\\'s leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast. He\\nknew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same\\nthing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order\\nby gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking out across the\\nmoonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to\\nthe great folds of the Garo hills.\\n\\n\"Tend to him if he grows restless in the night,\" said Big Toomai to\\nLittle Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was\\njust going to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a\\nlittle \"tang,\" and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as\\nsilently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai\\npattered after him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling\\nunder his breath, \"Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O Kala Nag!\"\\nThe elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the\\nboy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck,\\nand almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the\\nforest.\\n\\nThere was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the\\nsilence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes\\na tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the\\nsides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would\\nscrape along his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder\\ntouched it. But between those times he moved absolutely without any\\nsound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been\\nsmoke. He was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars\\nin the rifts of the trees, he could not tell in what direction.\\n\\nThen Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute,\\nand Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and\\nfurry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist\\nover the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he\\nfelt that the forest was awake below him--awake and alive and crowded.\\nA big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupine\\'s quills\\nrattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems he\\nheard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as\\nit digged.\\n\\nThen the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go\\ndown into the valley--not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes\\ndown a steep bank--in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as\\npistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow\\npoints rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a\\nnoise like torn canvas, and the saplings that he heaved away right and\\nleft with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank,\\nand great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his tusks\\nas he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway. Then\\nLittle Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging\\nbough should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back in\\nthe lines again.\\n\\nThe grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag\\'s feet sucked and squelched\\nas he put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley\\nchilled Little Toomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of\\nrunning water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling\\nhis way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round\\nthe elephant\\'s legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some\\ntrumpeting both upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and\\nall the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows.\\n\\n\"Ai!\" he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. \"The elephant-folk are\\nout tonight. It is the dance, then!\"\\n\\nKala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began\\nanother climb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make\\nhis path. That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where\\nthe bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many\\nelephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little\\nToomai looked back, and behind him a great wild tusker with his little\\npig\\'s eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the\\nmisty river. Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up,\\nwith trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on\\nevery side of them.\\n\\nAt last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top\\nof the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an\\nirregular space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as\\nLittle Toomai could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as\\na brick floor. Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their\\nbark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and\\npolished in the patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from\\nthe upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great\\nwaxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But\\nwithin the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of\\ngreen--nothing but the trampled earth.\\n\\nThe moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants\\nstood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked,\\nholding his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he\\nlooked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from\\nbetween the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and\\nhe counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the\\ntens, and his head began to swim. Outside the clearing he could hear\\nthem crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the\\nhillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks\\nthey moved like ghosts.\\n\\nThere were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and\\ntwigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears;\\nfat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black\\ncalves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young\\nelephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of\\nthem; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious\\nfaces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred\\nfrom shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights,\\nand the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their\\nshoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the\\nfull-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger\\'s claws on his\\nside.\\n\\nThey were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground\\nin couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores\\nof elephants.\\n\\nToomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag\\'s neck nothing\\nwould happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive\\na wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the\\nneck of a tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men\\nthat night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard\\nthe chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen\\nSahib\\'s pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling\\nup the hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from\\nPetersen Sahib\\'s camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that\\nhe did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too,\\nmust have run away from some camp in the hills about.\\n\\nAt last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest,\\nand Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into\\nthe middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants\\nbegan to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.\\n\\nStill lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of\\nbroad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling\\neyes. He heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by\\naccident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing\\nof enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick\\nand hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud came over the moon, and he\\nsat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and\\ngurgling went on just the same. He knew that there were elephants all\\nround Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him out of the\\nassembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least there\\nwas torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and\\nonce a trunk came up and touched him on the knee.\\n\\nThen an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten\\nterrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain\\non the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at\\nfirst, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and\\ngrew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and\\nbrought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as\\ntrip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and it\\nsounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from\\nthe trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on,\\nand the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up\\nto his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that\\nran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth.\\nOnce or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward\\na few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of\\njuicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom\\nof feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning\\nsomewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag\\nmoved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the\\nclearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two\\nor three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a\\nshuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours,\\nand Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the\\nnight air that the dawn was coming.\\n\\nThe morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills,\\nand the booming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had\\nbeen an order. Before Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head,\\nbefore even he had shifted his position, there was not an elephant in\\nsight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls,\\nand there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to\\nshow where the others had gone.\\n\\nLittle Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he remembered it,\\nhad grown in the night. More trees stood in the middle of it, but the\\nundergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back.\\nLittle Toomai stared once more. Now he understood the trampling. The\\nelephants had stamped out more room--had stamped the thick grass and\\njuicy cane to trash, the trash into slivers, the slivers into tiny\\nfibers, and the fibers into hard earth.\\n\\n\"Wah!\" said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy. \"Kala Nag, my\\nlord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib\\'s camp, or I shall\\ndrop from thy neck.\"\\n\\nThe third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and\\ntook his own path. He may have belonged to some little native king\\'s\\nestablishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.\\n\\nTwo hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his\\nelephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and\\nPudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled\\ninto the camp. Little Toomai\\'s face was gray and pinched, and his\\nhair was full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute\\nPetersen Sahib, and cried faintly: \"The dance--the elephant dance! I\\nhave seen it, and--I die!\" As Kala Nag sat down, he slid off his neck in\\na dead faint.\\n\\nBut, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two\\nhours he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib\\'s hammock with\\nPetersen Sahib\\'s shooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk,\\na little brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him, and while the\\nold hairy, scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him,\\nlooking at him as though he were a spirit, he told his tale in short\\nwords, as a child will, and wound up with:\\n\\n\"Now, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the\\nelephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and\\nthey will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that\\ndance-room. They made more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala\\nNag took me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!\"\\n\\nLittle Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into\\nthe twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed\\nthe track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills.\\nPetersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he\\nhad only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need\\nto look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to\\nscratch with his toe in the packed, rammed earth.\\n\\n\"The child speaks truth,\" said he. \"All this was done last night, and\\nI have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where\\nPudmini\\'s leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.\"\\n\\nThey looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the\\nways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to\\nfathom.\\n\\n\"Forty years and five,\" said Machua Appa, \"have I followed my lord, the\\nelephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what\\nthis child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we\\nsay?\" and he shook his head.\\n\\nWhen they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen\\nSahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should\\nhave two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and\\nrice and salt, for he knew that there would be a feast.\\n\\nBig Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for\\nhis son and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at\\nthem as though he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by\\nthe blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants,\\nand Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant\\ncatchers, the trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all\\nthe secrets of breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to\\nthe other, and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a\\nnewly killed jungle-cock, to show that he was a forester, initiated and\\nfree of all the jungles.\\n\\nAnd at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs\\nmade the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too,\\nMachua Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua\\nAppa, Petersen Sahib\\'s other self, who had never seen a made road in\\nforty years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he had no other name\\nthan Machua Appa,--leaped to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in\\nthe air above his head, and shouted: \"Listen, my brothers. Listen, too,\\nyou my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This\\nlittle one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the\\nElephants, as his great-grandfather was called before him. What never\\nman has seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the\\nelephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him. He shall\\nbecome a great tracker. He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua\\nAppa! He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed\\ntrail, with a clear eye! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he\\nruns under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he slips\\nbefore the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant\\nshall know who he is and shall not crush him. Aihai! my lords in the\\nchains,\"--he whirled up the line of pickets--\"here is the little one\\nthat has seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never\\nman saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. Make your\\nsalute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi\\nGuj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,--thou hast seen him at the dance, and\\nthou too, Kala Nag, my pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together! To Toomai\\nof the Elephants. Barrao!\"\\n\\nAnd at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the\\ntips touched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the\\ncrashing trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut\\nof the Keddah.\\n\\nBut it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never\\nman had seen before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in\\nthe heart of the Garo hills!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShiv and the Grasshopper\\n\\n     (The song that Toomai\\'s mother sang to the baby)\\n\\n     Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,\\n     Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,\\n     Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,\\n     From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.\\n        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.\\n        Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,--\\n        Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,\\n        And mother\\'s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!\\n\\n\\n     Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,\\n     Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;\\n     Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,\\n     And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.\\n     Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low--\\n     Parbati beside him watched them come and go;\\n     Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest--\\n     Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.\\n        So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver.\\n        Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  Turn and see.\\n        Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,\\n        But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!\\n\\n     When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,\\n     \"Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?\"\\n     Laughing, Shiv made answer, \"All have had their part,\\n     Even he, the little one, hidden \\'neath thy heart.\"\\n     From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,\\n     Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!\\n     Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,\\n     Who hath surely given meat to all that live.\\n        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.\\n        Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,--\\n        Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,\\n        And mother\\'s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHer Majesty\\'s Servants\\n\\n     You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,\\n     But the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.\\n     You can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,\\n     But the way of Pilly Winky\\'s not the way of Winkie Pop!\\n\\nIt had been raining heavily for one whole month--raining on a camp\\nof thirty thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses,\\nbullocks, and mules all gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi,\\nto be reviewed by the Viceroy of India. He was receiving a visit from\\nthe Amir of Afghanistan--a wild king of a very wild country. The Amir\\nhad brought with him for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who\\nhad never seen a camp or a locomotive before in their lives--savage\\nmen and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every\\nnight a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and\\nstampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or the camels\\nwould break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents,\\nand you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep.\\nMy tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe.\\nBut one night a man popped his head in and shouted, \"Get out, quick!\\nThey\\'re coming! My tent\\'s gone!\"\\n\\nI knew who \"they\" were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled\\nout into the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the\\nother side; and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling,\\nand I saw the tent cave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance\\nabout like a mad ghost. A camel had blundered into it, and wet and angry\\nas I was, I could not help laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not\\nknow how many camels might have got loose, and before long I was out of\\nsight of the camp, plowing my way through the mud.\\n\\nAt last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was\\nsomewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at\\nnight. As I did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and\\nthe dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and made a\\nsort of wigwam with two or three rammers that I found, and lay along the\\ntail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I might\\nbe.\\n\\nJust as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness\\nand a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to\\na screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings\\nand chains and things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little\\ncannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes\\nto use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find\\na road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.\\n\\nBehind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching\\nand slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a\\nstrayed hen\\'s. Luckily, I knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast\\nlanguage, but camp-beast language, of course--from the natives to know\\nwhat he was saying.\\n\\nHe must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to\\nthe mule, \"What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white\\nthing that waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.\" (That was\\nmy broken tent pole, and I was very glad to know it.) \"Shall we run on?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it was you,\" said the mule, \"you and your friends, that have\\nbeen disturbing the camp? All right. You\\'ll be beaten for this in the\\nmorning. But I may as well give you something on account now.\"\\n\\nI heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel\\ntwo kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum. \"Another time,\" he said,\\n\"you\\'ll know better than to run through a mule battery at night,\\nshouting `Thieves and fire!\\' Sit down, and keep your silly neck quiet.\"\\n\\nThe camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down\\nwhimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big\\ntroop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped\\na gun tail, and landed close to the mule.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" he said, blowing out his nostrils. \"Those camels\\nhave racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. How\\'s a\\nhorse to keep his condition if he isn\\'t allowed to sleep. Who\\'s here?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw\\nBattery,\" said the mule, \"and the other\\'s one of your friends. He\\'s\\nwaked me up too. Who are you?\"\\n\\n\"Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffe\\'s horse. Stand\\nover a little, there.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, beg your pardon,\" said the mule. \"It\\'s too dark to see much. Aren\\'t\\nthese camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get\\na little peace and quiet here.\"\\n\\n\"My lords,\" said the camel humbly, \"we dreamed bad dreams in the night,\\nand we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th\\nNative Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.\"\\n\\n\"Then why didn\\'t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native\\nInfantry, instead of running all round the camp?\" said the mule.\\n\\n\"They were such very bad dreams,\" said the camel. \"I am sorry. Listen!\\nWhat is that? Shall we run on again?\"\\n\\n\"Sit down,\" said the mule, \"or you\\'ll snap your long stick-legs between\\nthe guns.\" He cocked one ear and listened. \"Bullocks!\" he said. \"Gun\\nbullocks. On my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very\\nthoroughly. It takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.\"\\n\\nI heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky\\nwhite bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won\\'t\\ngo any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost\\nstepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for\\n\"Billy.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s one of our recruits,\" said the old mule to the troop horse.\\n\"He\\'s calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never\\nhurt anybody yet.\"\\n\\nThe gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the\\nyoung mule huddled close to Billy.\\n\\n\"Things!\" he said. \"Fearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our\\nlines while we were asleep. D\\'you think they\\'ll kill us?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,\" said Billy.\\n\"The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the\\nbattery before this gentleman!\"\\n\\n\"Gently, gently!\" said the troop-horse. \"Remember they are always like\\nthis to begin with. The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia\\nwhen I was a three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if I\\'d seen a\\ncamel, I should have been running still.\"\\n\\nNearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from\\nAustralia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.\\n\\n\"True enough,\" said Billy. \"Stop shaking, youngster. The first time\\nthey put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on\\nmy forelegs and kicked every bit of it off. I hadn\\'t learned the real\\nscience of kicking then, but the battery said they had never seen\\nanything like it.\"\\n\\n\"But this wasn\\'t harness or anything that jingled,\" said the young mule.\\n\"You know I don\\'t mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and\\nthey fell up and down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and\\nI couldn\\'t find my driver, and I couldn\\'t find you, Billy, so I ran off\\nwith--with these gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" said Billy. \"As soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away\\non my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks\\ngentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the\\nground there?\"\\n\\nThe gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: \"The\\nseventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We were asleep\\nwhen the camels came, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked\\naway. It is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good\\nbedding. We told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid\\nof, but he knew so much that he thought otherwise. Wah!\"\\n\\nThey went on chewing.\\n\\n\"That comes of being afraid,\" said Billy. \"You get laughed at by\\ngun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young un.\"\\n\\nThe young mule\\'s teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not\\nbeing afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks\\nonly clicked their horns together and went on chewing.\\n\\n\"Now, don\\'t be angry after you\\'ve been afraid. That\\'s the worst kind\\nof cowardice,\" said the troop-horse. \"Anybody can be forgiven for being\\nscared in the night, I think, if they see things they don\\'t understand.\\nWe\\'ve broken out of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty\\nof us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at\\nhome in Australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our\\nhead-ropes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all very well in camp,\" said Billy. \"I\\'m not above stampeding\\nmyself, for the fun of the thing, when I haven\\'t been out for a day or\\ntwo. But what do you do on active service?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s quite another set of new shoes,\" said the troop horse. \"Dick\\nCunliffe\\'s on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have\\nto do is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs\\nwell under me, and be bridle-wise.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s bridle-wise?\" said the young mule.\\n\\n\"By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,\" snorted the troop-horse, \"do you\\nmean to say that you aren\\'t taught to be bridle-wise in your business?\\nHow can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the\\nrein is pressed on your neck? It means life or death to your man, and of\\ncourse that\\'s life and death to you. Get round with your hind legs under\\nyou the instant you feel the rein on your neck. If you haven\\'t room to\\nswing round, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs. That\\'s\\nbeing bridle-wise.\"\\n\\n\"We aren\\'t taught that way,\" said Billy the mule stiffly. \"We\\'re taught\\nto obey the man at our head: step off when he says so, and step in when\\nhe says so. I suppose it comes to the same thing. Now, with all this\\nfine fancy business and rearing, which must be very bad for your hocks,\\nwhat do you do?\"\\n\\n\"That depends,\" said the troop-horse. \"Generally I have to go in among a\\nlot of yelling, hairy men with knives--long shiny knives, worse than\\nthe farrier\\'s knives--and I have to take care that Dick\\'s boot is just\\ntouching the next man\\'s boot without crushing it. I can see Dick\\'s lance\\nto the right of my right eye, and I know I\\'m safe. I shouldn\\'t care to\\nbe the man or horse that stood up to Dick and me when we\\'re in a hurry.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t the knives hurt?\" said the young mule.\\n\\n\"Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn\\'t Dick\\'s\\nfault--\"\\n\\n\"A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!\" said the\\nyoung mule.\\n\\n\"You must,\" said the troop horse. \"If you don\\'t trust your man, you may\\nas well run away at once. That\\'s what some of our horses do, and I don\\'t\\nblame them. As I was saying, it wasn\\'t Dick\\'s fault. The man was lying\\non the ground, and I stretched myself not to tread on him, and he\\nslashed up at me. Next time I have to go over a man lying down I shall\\nstep on him--hard.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" said Billy. \"It sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things\\nat any time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a\\nwell-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and\\ncreep and crawl and wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet\\nabove anyone else on a ledge where there\\'s just room enough for your\\nhoofs. Then you stand still and keep quiet--never ask a man to hold your\\nhead, young un--keep quiet while the guns are being put together, and\\nthen you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the tree-tops ever\\nso far below.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you ever trip?\" said the troop-horse.\\n\\n\"They say that when a mule trips you can split a hen\\'s ear,\" said Billy.\\n\"Now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but it\\'s\\nvery seldom. I wish I could show you our business. It\\'s beautiful. Why,\\nit took me three years to find out what the men were driving at. The\\nscience of the thing is never to show up against the sky line, because,\\nif you do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep\\nhidden as much as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your\\nway. I lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing.\"\\n\\n\"Fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!\"\\nsaid the troop-horse, thinking hard. \"I couldn\\'t stand that. I should\\nwant to charge--with Dick.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, you wouldn\\'t. You know that as soon as the guns are in\\nposition they\\'ll do all the charging. That\\'s scientific and neat. But\\nknives--pah!\"\\n\\nThe baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time\\npast, anxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him say, as he\\ncleared his throat, nervously:\\n\\n\"I--I--I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that\\nrunning way.\"\\n\\n\"No. Now you mention it,\" said Billy, \"you don\\'t look as though you were\\nmade for climbing or running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?\"\\n\\n\"The proper way,\" said the camel. \"We all sat down--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my crupper and breastplate!\" said the troop-horse under his breath.\\n\"Sat down!\"\\n\\n\"We sat down--a hundred of us,\" the camel went on, \"in a big square, and\\nthe men piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired\\nover our backs, the men did, on all sides of the square.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of men? Any men that came along?\" said the troop-horse. \"They\\nteach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across\\nus, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I\\'d trust to do that. It tickles\\nmy girths, and, besides, I can\\'t see with my head on the ground.\"\\n\\n\"What does it matter who fires across you?\" said the camel. \"There are\\nplenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many\\nclouds of smoke. I am not frightened then. I sit still and wait.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Billy, \"you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at\\nnight. Well, well! Before I\\'d lie down, not to speak of sitting down,\\nand let a man fire across me, my heels and his head would have something\\nto say to each other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his\\nbig head and said, \"This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way\\nof fighting.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, go on,\" said Billy. \"Please don\\'t mind me. I suppose you fellows\\nfight standing on your tails?\"\\n\\n\"Only one way,\" said the two together. (They must have been twins.)\\n\"This is that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon\\nas Two Tails trumpets.\" (\"Two Tails\" is camp slang for the elephant.)\\n\\n\"What does Two Tails trumpet for?\" said the young mule.\\n\\n\"To show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other\\nside. Two Tails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all\\ntogether--Heya--Hullah! Heeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor\\nrun like calves. We go across the level plain, twenty yoke of us, till\\nwe are unyoked again, and we graze while the big guns talk across the\\nplain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of the wall fall out, and\\nthe dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! And you choose that time for grazing?\" said the young mule.\\n\\n\"That time or any other. Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked\\nup again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it.\\nSometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of\\nus are killed, and then there is all the more grazing for those that are\\nleft. This is Fate. None the less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is\\nthe proper way to fight. We are brothers from Hapur. Our father was a\\nsacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve certainly learned something tonight,\" said the troop-horse.\\n\"Do you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you\\nare being fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?\"\\n\\n\"About as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all\\nover us, or run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff. A\\nmountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you\\npick your own way, and I\\'m your mule. But--the other things--no!\" said\\nBilly, with a stamp of his foot.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said the troop horse, \"everyone is not made in the same\\nway, and I can quite see that your family, on your father\\'s side, would\\nfail to understand a great many things.\"\\n\\n\"Never you mind my family on my father\\'s side,\" said Billy angrily, for\\nevery mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey. \"My father\\nwas a Southern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into\\nrags every horse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!\"\\n\\nBrumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of\\nSunol if a car-horse called her a \"skate,\" and you can imagine how the\\nAustralian horse felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.\\n\\n\"See here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,\" he said between\\nhis teeth, \"I\\'d have you know that I\\'m related on my mother\\'s side to\\nCarbine, winner of the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we aren\\'t\\naccustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed,\\npig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery. Are you ready?\"\\n\\n\"On your hind legs!\" squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each\\nother, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly\\nvoice, called out of the darkness to the right--\"Children, what are you\\nfighting about there? Be quiet.\"\\n\\nBoth beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor\\nmule can bear to listen to an elephant\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Two Tails!\" said the troop-horse. \"I can\\'t stand him. A tail at\\neach end isn\\'t fair!\"\\n\\n\"My feelings exactly,\" said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for\\ncompany. \"We\\'re very alike in some things.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose we\\'ve inherited them from our mothers,\" said the troop horse.\\n\"It\\'s not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. \"I\\'m picketed for\\nthe night. I\\'ve heard what you fellows have been saying. But don\\'t be\\nafraid. I\\'m not coming over.\"\\n\\nThe bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, \"Afraid of Two Tails--what\\nnonsense!\" And the bullocks went on, \"We are sorry that you heard, but\\nit is true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly\\nlike a little boy saying a poem, \"I don\\'t quite know whether you\\'d\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t, but we have to pull the guns,\" said the bullocks.\\n\\n\"I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think\\nyou are. But it\\'s different with me. My battery captain called me a\\nPachydermatous Anachronism the other day.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s another way of fighting, I suppose?\" said Billy, who was\\nrecovering his spirits.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt\\nand between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what\\nwill happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I can,\" said the troop-horse. \"At least a little bit. I try not to\\nthink about it.\"\\n\\n\"I can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there\\'s a\\ngreat deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to\\ncure me when I\\'m sick. All they can do is to stop my driver\\'s pay till I\\nget well, and I can\\'t trust my driver.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said the troop horse. \"That explains it. I can trust Dick.\"\\n\\n\"You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me\\nfeel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough\\nto go on in spite of it.\"\\n\\n\"We do not understand,\" said the bullocks.\\n\\n\"I know you don\\'t. I\\'m not talking to you. You don\\'t know what blood\\nis.\"\\n\\n\"We do,\" said the bullocks. \"It is red stuff that soaks into the ground\\nand smells.\"\\n\\nThe troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk of it,\" he said. \"I can smell it now, just thinking of it.\\nIt makes me want to run--when I haven\\'t Dick on my back.\"\\n\\n\"But it is not here,\" said the camel and the bullocks. \"Why are you so\\nstupid?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s vile stuff,\" said Billy. \"I don\\'t want to run, but I don\\'t want to\\ntalk about it.\"\\n\\n\"There you are!\" said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.\\n\\n\"Surely. Yes, we have been here all night,\" said the bullocks.\\n\\nTwo Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. \"Oh, I\\'m\\nnot talking to you. You can\\'t see inside your heads.\"\\n\\n\"No. We see out of our four eyes,\" said the bullocks. \"We see straight\\nin front of us.\"\\n\\n\"If I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn\\'t be needed to pull the\\nbig guns at all. If I was like my captain--he can see things inside his\\nhead before the firing begins, and he shakes all over, but he knows too\\nmuch to run away--if I was like him I could pull the guns. But if I were\\nas wise as all that I should never be here. I should be a king in the\\nforest, as I used to be, sleeping half the day and bathing when I liked.\\nI haven\\'t had a good bath for a month.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all very fine,\" said Billy. \"But giving a thing a long name\\ndoesn\\'t make it any better.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'sh!\" said the troop horse. \"I think I understand what Two Tails\\nmeans.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll understand better in a minute,\" said Two Tails angrily. \"Now you\\njust explain to me why you don\\'t like this!\"\\n\\nHe began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.\\n\\n\"Stop that!\" said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could\\nhear them stamp and shiver. An elephant\\'s trumpeting is always nasty,\\nespecially on a dark night.\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t stop,\" said Two Tails. \"Won\\'t you explain that, please?\\nHhrrmph! Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!\" Then he stopped suddenly, and I heard\\na little whimper in the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last.\\nShe knew as well as I did that if there is one thing in the world the\\nelephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. So\\nshe stopped to bully Two Tails in his pickets, and yapped round his big\\nfeet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. \"Go away, little dog!\" he said.\\n\"Don\\'t snuff at my ankles, or I\\'ll kick at you. Good little dog--nice\\nlittle doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast! Oh, why doesn\\'t\\nsomeone take her away? She\\'ll bite me in a minute.\"\\n\\n\"Seems to me,\" said Billy to the troop horse, \"that our friend Two Tails\\nis afraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I\\'ve\\nkicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.\"\\n\\nI whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose,\\nand told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I\\nnever let her know that I understood beast talk, or she would have\\ntaken all sorts of liberties. So I buttoned her into the breast of my\\novercoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped and growled to himself.\\n\\n\"Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!\" he said. \"It runs in our family.\\nNow, where has that nasty little beast gone to?\"\\n\\nI heard him feeling about with his trunk.\\n\\n\"We all seem to be affected in various ways,\" he went on, blowing his\\nnose. \"Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.\"\\n\\n\"Not alarmed, exactly,\" said the troop-horse, \"but it made me feel as\\nthough I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don\\'t begin again.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad\\ndreams in the night.\"\\n\\n\"It is very lucky for us that we haven\\'t all got to fight in the same\\nway,\" said the troop-horse.\\n\\n\"What I want to know,\" said the young mule, who had been quiet for a\\nlong time--\"what I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.\"\\n\\n\"Because we\\'re told to,\" said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.\\n\\n\"Orders,\" said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.\\n\\n\"Hukm hai!\" (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two\\nTails and the bullocks repeated, \"Hukm hai!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but who gives the orders?\" said the recruit-mule.\\n\\n\"The man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or holds the nose\\nrope--Or twists your tail,\" said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel\\nand the bullocks one after the other.\\n\\n\"But who gives them the orders?\"\\n\\n\"Now you want to know too much, young un,\" said Billy, \"and that is one\\nway of getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your\\nhead and ask no questions.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s quite right,\" said Two Tails. \"I can\\'t always obey, because I\\'m\\nbetwixt and between. But Billy\\'s right. Obey the man next to you who\\ngives the order, or you\\'ll stop all the battery, besides getting a\\nthrashing.\"\\n\\nThe gun-bullocks got up to go. \"Morning is coming,\" they said. \"We will\\ngo back to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and\\nwe are not very clever. But still, we are the only people to-night who\\nhave not been afraid. Good-night, you brave people.\"\\n\\nNobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation,\\n\"Where\\'s that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.\"\\n\\n\"Here I am,\" yapped Vixen, \"under the gun tail with my man. You big,\\nblundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man\\'s very\\nangry.\"\\n\\n\"Phew!\" said the bullocks. \"He must be white!\"\\n\\n\"Of course he is,\" said Vixen. \"Do you suppose I\\'m looked after by a\\nblack bullock-driver?\"\\n\\n\"Huah! Ouach! Ugh!\" said the bullocks. \"Let us get away quickly.\"\\n\\nThey plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke\\non the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.\\n\\n\"Now you have done it,\" said Billy calmly. \"Don\\'t struggle. You\\'re hung\\nup till daylight. What on earth\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\nThe bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle\\ngive, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and\\nnearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll break your necks in a minute,\" said the troop-horse. \"What\\'s the\\nmatter with white men? I live with \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"They--eat--us! Pull!\" said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a\\ntwang, and they lumbered off together.\\n\\nI never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen.\\nWe eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and of course the\\ncattle do not like it.\\n\\n\"May I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who\\'d have thought of two big\\nlumps like those losing their heads?\" said Billy.\\n\\n\"Never mind. I\\'m going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I\\nknow, have things in their pockets,\" said the troop-horse.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll leave you, then. I can\\'t say I\\'m over-fond of \\'em myself. Besides,\\nwhite men who haven\\'t a place to sleep in are more than likely to be\\nthieves, and I\\'ve a good deal of Government property on my back. Come\\nalong, young un, and we\\'ll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia!\\nSee you on parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try\\nto control your feelings, won\\'t you? Good-night, Two Tails! If you pass\\nus on the ground tomorrow, don\\'t trumpet. It spoils our formation.\"\\n\\nBilly the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old\\ncampaigner, as the troop-horse\\'s head came nuzzling into my breast, and\\nI gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog,\\ntold him fibs about the scores of horses that she and I kept.\\n\\n\"I\\'m coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,\" she said. \"Where\\nwill you be?\"\\n\\n\"On the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my\\ntroop, little lady,\" he said politely. \"Now I must go back to Dick. My\\ntail\\'s all muddy, and he\\'ll have two hours\\' hard work dressing me for\\nparade.\"\\n\\nThe big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon,\\nand Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of\\nAfghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great\\ndiamond star in the center. The first part of the review was all\\nsunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving\\ntogether, and guns all in a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the\\ncavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of \"Bonnie Dundee,\" and\\nVixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The second squadron\\nof the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail\\nlike spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one\\nback, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly\\nas waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two\\nother elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while\\ntwenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and\\nthey looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy\\nthe mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and his\\nharness was oiled and polished till it winked. I gave a cheer all by\\nmyself for Billy the mule, but he never looked right or left.\\n\\nThe rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see\\nwhat the troops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the\\nplain, and were spreading out into a line. That line grew and grew and\\ngrew till it was three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing--one\\nsolid wall of men, horses, and guns. Then it came on straight toward the\\nViceroy and the Amir, and as it got nearer the ground began to shake,\\nlike the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast.\\n\\nUnless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect\\nthis steady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they\\nknow it is only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he had not\\nshown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his\\neyes began to get bigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his\\nhorse\\'s neck and looked behind him. For a minute it seemed as though he\\nwere going to draw his sword and slash his way out through the English\\nmen and women in the carriages at the back. Then the advance stopped\\ndead, the ground stood still, the whole line saluted, and thirty bands\\nbegan to play all together. That was the end of the review, and the\\nregiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry band\\nstruck up with--\\n\\n     The animals went in two by two,\\n          Hurrah!\\n     The animals went in two by two,\\n     The elephant and the battery mul\\',\\n     and they all got into the Ark\\n          For to get out of the rain!\\n\\nThen I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had\\ncome down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"in what manner was this wonderful thing done?\"\\n\\nAnd the officer answered, \"An order was given, and they obeyed.\"\\n\\n\"But are the beasts as wise as the men?\" said the chief.\\n\\n\"They obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he\\nobeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his\\nlieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and the captain his major,\\nand the major his colonel, and the colonel his brigadier commanding\\nthree regiments, and the brigadier the general, who obeys the Viceroy,\\nwho is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is done.\"\\n\\n\"Would it were so in Afghanistan!\" said the chief, \"for there we obey\\nonly our own wills.\"\\n\\n\"And for that reason,\" said the native officer, twirling his mustache,\\n\"your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our\\nViceroy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParade Song of the Camp Animals\\n\\n     ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS\\n\\n     We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,\\n     The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;\\n     We bowed our necks to service: they ne\\'er were loosed again,--\\n     Make way there--way for the ten-foot teams\\n           Of the Forty-Pounder train!\\n\\n     GUN BULLOCKS\\n\\n     Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,\\n     And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;\\n     Then we come into action and tug the guns again--\\n     Make way there--way for the twenty yoke\\n           Of the Forty-Pounder train!\\n\\n     CAVALRY HORSES\\n\\n     By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes\\n     Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,\\n     And it\\'s sweeter than \"Stables\" or \"Water\" to me--\\n     The Cavalry Canter of \"Bonnie Dundee\"!\\n\\n     Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,\\n     And give us good riders and plenty of room,\\n     And launch us in column of squadron and see\\n     The way of the war-horse to \"Bonnie Dundee\"!\\n\\n     SCREW-GUN MULES\\n\\n     As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,\\n     The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;\\n     For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,\\n     Oh, it\\'s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to\\n        spare!\\n\\n     Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road;\\n     Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load:\\n     For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,\\n     Oh, it\\'s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to\\n        spare!\\n\\n     COMMISSARIAT CAMELS\\n\\n     We haven\\'t a camelty tune of our own\\n     To help us trollop along,\\n     But every neck is a hair trombone\\n     (Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!)\\n     And this our marching-song:\\n     Can\\'t!

       " 1342: '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE\\n\\nBy Jane Austen\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property\\nof some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\\nNetherfield Park is let at last?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\\ntold me all about it.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n\"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\\n\\n\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\\ndelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he\\nis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to\\nbe in the house by the end of next week.\"\\n\\n\"What is his name?\"\\n\\n\"Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"Is he married or single?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\n\\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.\"\\n\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\\nparty.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\\ngo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\\nnewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\\nvisit him if you do not.\"\\n\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\"\\n\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\\ntake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese last twenty years at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\nvisit them.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,\\nshe fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring\\nhis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\nsuddenly addressed her with:\\n\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\\nresentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\\nof her.\"\\n\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do\\nnot depend on her serving you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake! Have a little\\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times\\nthem ill.\"\\n\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully. \"When is\\nyour next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back\\ntill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\\nfor she will not know him herself.\"\\n\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\\nMr. Bingley to _her_.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\n\\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is certainly\\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,\\nMrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as\\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\\ntake it on myself.\"\\n\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\\nnonsense!\"\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\\ngreat books and make extracts.\"\\n\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\n\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\n\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If\\nI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called\\non him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\n\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy\\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\\nwhile.\\n\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\\nword about it till now.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the door was\\nshut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\\nor me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so\\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\\nfor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\\nball.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\\nreturn Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\\ndinner.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\\nin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\\nhopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart were entertained.\\n\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well\\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\n\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat about\\nten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had\\nheard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\\nwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\n\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already\\nhad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable\\nto accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\\nhe might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears\\na little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get\\na large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\\nwas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\\nThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\\nday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\\nsix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when\\nthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\\naltogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\\nanother young man.\\n\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\\nthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\\nwas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\\nproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\\nhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\\nwith his friend.\\n\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\\npeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\\none himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\nin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\nstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\\nBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\\nto join it.\\n\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\ndance.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\\nit would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\nstand up with.\"\\n\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley, \"for a\\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\\nmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\\nuncommonly pretty.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a moment at\\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\\n\"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\nremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\n\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\\nher mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\\na book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s views on\\nthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\\ndifferent story to hear.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\\ntwice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\\nand the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\\nand the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\"\\n\\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\\n\"he would not have danced half so much! For God\\'s sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\nhandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\\nanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\\nHurst\\'s gown--\"\\n\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very\\nmuch she admired him.\\n\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much\\nease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\n\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought\\nlikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\\n\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\ndid not expect such a compliment.\"\\n\\n\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between\\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\\nin the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\nstupider person.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\\nwhat I think.\"\\n\\n\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it\\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the\\ngood of everybody\\'s character and make it still better, and say nothing\\nof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man\\'s sisters,\\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\nneighbour in her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\\nand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\\nwas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine\\nladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\npower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\nconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\\nfirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\npounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\\nassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\\nentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\\na respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune and their\\nown had been acquired by trade.\\n\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\nestate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\npurchase.\\n\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation\\nto look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for\\nhalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal\\nrooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it\\nimmediately.\\n\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley\\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\\nIn understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\ndeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\nreserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\ngiving offense.\\n\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or\\nprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive\\nto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\\nacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\\nconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\\ncollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\\nnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\\neither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\nbut she smiled too much.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one\\nwhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such\\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\\nThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\ndisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\\nand, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\\nabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\\nwhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\\nunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\\nthe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\nsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\\nnature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\\nJames\\'s had made him courteous.\\n\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\\nElizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\n\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over\\na ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\\n\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil\\nself-command to Miss Lucas. \"_You_ were Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\nabout Mr. Robinson.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\\'s asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many\\npretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question: \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as\\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\"\\n\\n\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\\nCharlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.\\n\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at\\nbeing spoke to.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably\\nagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\\nthe ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I\\nwish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_,\\nif I were you.\"\\n\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\\n\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\\n\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\\nbe proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who came with\\nhis sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\\nBennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.\"\\n\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\\nwould, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\nwas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet\\'s pleasing manners grew on\\nthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\\nthe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\\npleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\\nof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\nall probability from the influence of their brother\\'s admiration. It\\nwas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\nunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\\nuniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\\nof the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose\\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\\nthe dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\\ndiscover it too.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\\nfalling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\n\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\\nquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined\\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\nthese are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,\\nshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\nand has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite\\nenough to make her understand his character.\"\\n\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\nremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\\nevenings may do a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\\nboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and\\nif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\\n\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\nallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\\nhad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\\nthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\\nto dance with.\\n\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\\'s, where a large party were\\nassembled.\\n\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my\\nconversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\n\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\\n\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\\na subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\\nturned to him and said:\\n\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\nwell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\\nMeryton?\"\\n\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\nenergetic.\"\\n\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\n\\n\"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going\\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\\n\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\\na musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\\nhearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however,\\nshe added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing\\nat Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\ncourse familiar with: \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\'; and I\\nshall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\n\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that\\nshe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\\nimpatient for display.\\n\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\\nwith some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\\ndancing at one end of the room.\\n\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\\nmuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\\nhis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\n\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\\nis nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first\\nrefinements of polished society.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\nthe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\"\\n\\nSir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I doubt\\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\\nyou often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\\n\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\n\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\n\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond\\nof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\n\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed\\nto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\\nstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\\nher:\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\"\\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny\\nme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\\nfor one half-hour.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,\\nwe cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a\\npartner?\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\\ninjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\n\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\n\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\n\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\\nin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\\nI was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the\\nnothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would\\nI give to hear your strictures on them!\"\\n\\n\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\\nMr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all astonishment.\\nHow long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you\\njoy?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\\'s\\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\nabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;\\nand, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\"\\n\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\\'s\\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\\n\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to\\ntheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.\\n\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and\\nto a milliner\\'s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters\\', and when nothing\\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\\nfrom their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\\nnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\\nneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the\\nheadquarters.\\n\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\ninteresting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge\\nof the officers\\' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a\\nsecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.\\nPhillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of\\nfelicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and\\nMr. Bingley\\'s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation\\nto their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the\\nregimentals of an ensign.\\n\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\nBennet coolly observed:\\n\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\\nI am now convinced.\"\\n\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,\\nand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\\nnext morning to London.\\n\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should be so\\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\\nof anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own, however.\"\\n\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\n\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\\nfoolish.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when\\nI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\\nshould want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in\\nhis regimentals.\"\\n\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did when they first\\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\\'s library.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with\\na note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\\n\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\n\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\n\\n\"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,\\nwe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,\\nfor a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a\\nquarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the\\ngentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,\\n\\n\"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\n\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia. \"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\\n_that_.\"\\n\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\n\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\\nrain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\n\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that\\nthey would not offer to send her home.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to Meryton,\\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\n\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\"\\n\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\n\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s purpose\\nwill be answered.\"\\n\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\\nwere engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a\\nbad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before\\nit rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\\nJane certainly could not come back.\\n\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more than\\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the\\nnext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\n\\n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\\nimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not\\nhear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\\nJones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\\nto me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\nmatter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\\naloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\\nshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\\ncolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\\nall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\\nthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking\\nwas her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a\\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\nthere.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\\n\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the\\nhorses?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing\\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\\n\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.\\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may\\nsee something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\n\\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\nof the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\nover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\\nwithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face\\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\nbrother\\'s manners there was something better than politeness; there\\nwas good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\nHurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\\nto the occasion\\'s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\nthinking only of his breakfast.\\n\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\\nwell enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\nalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\nhowever, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\\ntogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\nher.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\\na violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\\nfact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\\nin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\\nof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\\nElizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\\nLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply\\nof clothes.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s, she could not make a very\\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored\\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\n\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\nattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\neat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain\\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\npronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\\nshe had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the\\nsame, and added:\\n\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\nlooked almost wild.\"\\n\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\\nhide it not doing its office.\"\\n\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\\nwell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\\nescaped my notice.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such\\nan exhibition.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\nabove her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\na most country-town indifference to decorum.\"\\n\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\nBingley.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \"that\\nthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\" A\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\n\\n\"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\\nsweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\\nsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\\nno chance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\n\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\n\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\\nwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\ndownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\\n_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\\nI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\n\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\\ntable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers--all that his library afforded.\\n\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever looked into.\"\\n\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.\\n\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.\"\\n\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\\nbooks.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.\"\\n\\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\\nlittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\\nnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\\neldest sister, to observe the game.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\\nshe be as tall as I am?\"\\n\\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or\\nrather taller.\"\\n\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\\n\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\n\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\\nnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\\nI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\\ninformed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\\nall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half-deserved.\"\\n\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must\\nyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\\nextensive reading.\"\\n\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\\n\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.\\n\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\\n\"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\\nother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\\nsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n\"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.\\n\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\\nunwilling to comply with their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled\\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\nhowever, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\\nto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\\nattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and in the\\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\ninquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\nown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter\\'s proposal of being carried\\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\na little longer on your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\nsure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n\"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she\\nremains with us.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\\na vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\ntemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\\nnothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\\ncharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\\ncountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it\\nin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\nthrough I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n\\n\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\\nstudier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\nleast that advantage.\"\\n\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few subjects for\\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\nunvarying society.\"\\n\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\\na country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\ngoing on in the country as in town.\"\\n\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\nvictory over him, continued her triumph.\\n\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\npleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\\nat all.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\nmother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\\nwhich you must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\\nwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\"\\n\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\nsaying something that might turn her mother\\'s thoughts, now asked her if\\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\\ngenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\\nimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\n\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\\n_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\\nI assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\\nGardiner\\'s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\\nsure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\\ndid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\\non her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\\n\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\n\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\nattention of the officers, to whom her uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own\\neasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\\nequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\nabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\nshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\\nsudden attack was delightful to their mother\\'s ear:\\n\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\\n\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\\nwait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\\nadded, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\' behaviour to the\\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\nall Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.\\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\nthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\ncommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness\\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\nexactly in union with her opinion of each.\\n\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\n\\nHe made no answer.\\n\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\\n\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\"\\n\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\n\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\\npens remarkably well.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\\n\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;\\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\\nGrantley\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\\npresent I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me\\nto determine.\"\\n\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\\nease, cannot write ill.\"\\n\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\\nbrother, \"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\\nwords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\nindirect boast.\"\\n\\n\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\\nquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,\\nI believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\nyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\'Bingley, you had better\\nstay till next week,\\' you would probably do it, you would probably not\\ngo--and at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\\nmore than he did himself.\"\\n\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\nintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a\\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\ncould.\"\\n\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions\\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for\\nhimself.\"\\n\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\\none argument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.\"\\n\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?\"\\n\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\nyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\nknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\\nwhen he has nothing to do.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\\n\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike an argument,\\nand want to silence this.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\nfor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity\\nto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\\nthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\nseated herself.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed\\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\\nbecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\\nmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\\n\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by\\na lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\nElizabeth, said to her:\\n\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\nopportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\n\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\nsurprise at her silence.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \\'Yes,\\'\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\\nyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\\nyou dare.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy\\nhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\nbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\nshould be in some danger.\\n\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery\\nthe next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\nand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\\nofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\nwhich your lady possesses.\"\\n\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed\\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\\nlines. As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you must not have it taken, for\\nwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\ncopied.\"\\n\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\nElizabeth herself.\\n\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some\\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running away without\\ntelling us that you were coming out.\"\\n\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\\nand immediately said:\\n\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\navenue.\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\nlaughingly answered:\\n\\n\"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear\\nto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\nfourth. Good-bye.\"\\n\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\\ndrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\\nprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\\nas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\\nTheir powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\\nentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\\nat their acquaintance with spirit.\\n\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\\nMiss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\nhimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also\\nmade her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness\\nand warmth remained for Bingley\\'s salutation. He was full of joy and\\nattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire\\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\\nthe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\nelse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\ndelight.\\n\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and\\nthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\\nsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets\\nand rings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with Miss\\nBennet.\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she\\nwas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\nquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant\\nit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\nan excellent library.\"\\n\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\ncast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing\\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\ntowards him and said:\\n\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\\nnot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\npleasure.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\nchooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send\\nround my cards.\"\\n\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\\nthe day.\"\\n\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\\nnear so much like a ball.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked\\nabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but\\nDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In\\nthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,\\nturning to Elizabeth, said:\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\nlong in one attitude.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\ninterfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\nmeaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\\non us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing\\nabout it.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\nanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his\\ntwo motives.\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\\nas she allowed him to speak. \"You either choose this method of passing\\nthe evening because you are in each other\\'s confidence, and have secret\\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be\\ncompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better\\nas I sit by the fire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard anything so\\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has\\nnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of\\nmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will\\nnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\\nsubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a\\nlaugh.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\nThe wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their\\nactions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in\\nlife is a joke.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I\\nam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\\nFollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,\\nand I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely\\nwhat you are without.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\\nof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\nunderstanding to ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley;\\n\"and pray what is the result?\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\nhimself without disguise.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the\\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others\\nso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings\\nare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost\\nforever.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\\n\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n\\n\"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\"\\n\\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to misunderstand\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\nconversation in which she had no share. \"Louisa, you will not mind my\\nwaking Mr. Hurst?\"\\n\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not sorry for\\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\\nnext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\\nthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\\nwould exactly finish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive\\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them\\nvery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\\ncontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work\\non Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike\\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\\nshe felt herself to be right.\\n\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\\nBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.\\nHe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\\nshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope\\nof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were\\nat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most\\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\\nall, took place. Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her\\nto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\\nthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\\n\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of\\nits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and\\nElizabeth.\\n\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human\\nnature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of\\nthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\\nfor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said\\nin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\\nhad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it\\nhad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\"\\n\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners\\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\"\\n\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled. \"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\\nBingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.\\nBingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be\\ngot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this\\nmoment.\"\\n\\n\"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom I\\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\n\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\\neagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.\\n\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:\\n\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago\\nI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring\\nearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,\\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\\nchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\\nto do something or other about it.\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They\\nhad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which\\nMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail\\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of\\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\\nfriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did\\nbefore him?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\\nhead, as you will hear.\"\\n\\n\"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\\n\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\n\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\\nfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the\\nmisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but\\nfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might\\nseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone\\nwith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--\\'There, Mrs.\\nBennet.\\'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has\\npreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be\\nmy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\nladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which\\nare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I\\nfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\\nall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\\nflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and\\nthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate\\nwill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the\\noffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the\\nmeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible\\namends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to\\nreceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting\\non you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and\\nshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight\\nfollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine\\nis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided\\nthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\n\\n\"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\n\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\"\\nsaid Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \"He seems to be a most\\nconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will\\nprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\\nindulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\\n\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if\\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\\ndiscourage him.\"\\n\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can mean\\nto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\\ncredit.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady\\nCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make him\\nout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he\\nmean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he\\nwould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\\nletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\"\\n\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\ndefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\\nthink it is well expressed.\"\\n\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\\ndegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\\nastonished her husband and daughters.\\n\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in\\nneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a\\ntall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this\\ninstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\\nnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This\\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\\nBennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.\\n\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\\nprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\\noddly.\"\\n\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\\nI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,\\nwhen we are better acquainted--\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\\'s admiration. The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its\\ncooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a\\ngood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\\nbegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\\nquarter of an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh\\'s attention to his wishes, and consideration for\\nhis comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\\nhe protested that \"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in\\na person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\\napprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\\ntwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\nto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\"\\n\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and\\nI dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\\n\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\\nfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\n\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\"\\n\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\nextensive property.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\"\\n\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\nhandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\\nthe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\nconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\\naccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\ncourt.\"\\n\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\\nBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\\nto ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\\nher charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\npay.\"\\n\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\\nin his pleasure.\\n\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,\\nglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily\\nassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\\nannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and\\nbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at\\nhim, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the\\nvolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three\\npages, she interrupted him with:\\n\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\nRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\\n\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\n\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\\nme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\\'s\\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\nfor backgammon.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part\\nof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which\\nhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father\\'s\\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\npart.\\n\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a\\nquarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. \"As to\\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her\\n_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\nthe day before was now high in her good graces.\\n\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\nhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\nthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\\n\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were\\nimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\\na shop window, could recall them.\\n\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\nwith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was\\nthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\\nto inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the\\nstranger\\'s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\\ndetermined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\\npretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\\nhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\\nreached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\npermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\\nhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\\ncommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\\nyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\\nHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\\nbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\\nThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\\nof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\\nvery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\\nand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\\nladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\nbegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\\nMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\\nLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\\nit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\\non Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\\nlooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\\nBoth changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\\nafter a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\ndeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\\nimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\n\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\nMr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\\'s\\npressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\\ninvitation.\\n\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\\nfrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\\neagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\\ntheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\\nabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the\\nstreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\\nNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\\nwas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him. She\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\\nas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\nacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\\nhowever, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\\nintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\\nexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\\nput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\\nhowever, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\\nMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the\\nlast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\\nWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\\noccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\\nthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\\n\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either\\nor both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain\\nsuch behaviour than her sister.\\n\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\\nfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement with their\\naunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and\\nthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in\\nthe house.\\n\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast\\nparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what\\nRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\nwith the housekeeper\\'s room.\\n\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and\\nthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\\nThe gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\\nThe officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\ngentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\\nMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\\nthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\\ninteresting by the skill of the speaker.\\n\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\nlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he\\nhad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\n\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad\\nto improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips was very\\nglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\n\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\\nseemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\nand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\\nhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\ntold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\\neven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\ndrop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one. A clear\\nten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more\\ncapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\\nI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\\ninfancy.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly. \"I have\\nspent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\ndisagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\\nto be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\\nthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"\\n\\n\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\nill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n\\n\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\\nof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\\nis. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\\nbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\\na thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\nmemory of his father.\"\\n\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\n\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\\nhe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\\nintelligible gallantry.\\n\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\\na most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\nattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\nwere speaking of just now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\nelsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be? How could his\\nwill be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\"\\n\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\\nit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\\nof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\\nI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\\nrecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\\nof men, and that he hates me.\"\\n\\n\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n\\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\\n\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\never as he expressed them.\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive? What can\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\\'s uncommon\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\nof preference which was often given me.\"\\n\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis.\"\\n\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\\nmust be dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I can hardly\\nbe just to him.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!\" She could have added, \"A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented herself\\nwith, \"and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\\nconnected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\n\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\\nuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendence,\\nand when, immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may\\nbe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\\nnone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.\"\\n\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\\nhis father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\\nto degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\ncareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\\nspeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\\'s death, her\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\neducation.\"\\n\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\n\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\\nknow Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.\"\\n\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\\na very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\\npride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\\nfor fortune and figure.\"\\n\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\nthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\\npoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\\nhe assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\\nimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\\nthat she would not make herself uneasy.\\n\\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\\ncard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\nare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\nlittle matters.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\\nwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him\\na living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\nyesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\n\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\nself-destined for another.\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\\nnephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an\\nunderstanding of the first class.\"\\n\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\nthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper\\nput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham\\'s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise\\nof Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\\nMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.\\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she\\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\\npossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\\nand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\notherwise explained.\\n\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way\\nor other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\nwithout actual blame on either side.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on\\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\nbusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\nsomebody.\"\\n\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s favourite in such\\na manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\"\\n\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on, than\\nthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\\nlast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it\\nbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\\nlooks.\"\\n\\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\\nthink.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\n\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,\\nif he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair\\nbecame public.\\n\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\nconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had\\nbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal\\ninvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed\\nfor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly\\nasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To\\nthe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\\nas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\nthe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an\\nactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if\\neager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\n\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered\\nby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look\\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\nless on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\\nhad no disinclination for it.\\n\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough--I\\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those\\nwho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\neverybody.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did\\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s invitation, and if\\nhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\\'s\\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\\neither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\ndance.\\n\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball\\nof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,\\ncan have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,\\na preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\\nengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\ninstead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help\\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce\\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\\'s proposal accepted with as\\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\\ngallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy\\nof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\nwas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this\\ntime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there\\nwas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton\\nonce. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very\\nshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have\\nfound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\nMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty\\nof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose\\nthe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s\\npleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the officers; and though\\nthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\npronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who\\ntold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the\\nday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\\n\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\nhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\n\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\nElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\nWickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every\\nfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\nAttendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition\\nto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\\nnotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;\\nthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\\npartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\\nhim was ecstasy.\\n\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took\\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\\nwithout knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\nmind; Charlotte tried to console her:\\n\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\nevil.\"\\n\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\nin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\nreading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in beholding\\nit. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\\nsome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\nwith:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\\nabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\\nof the room, or the number of couples.\"\\n\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\\nobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But\\n_now_ we may be silent.\"\\n\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\nposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\\nsaid he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\\nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\\n\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said, \"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\\nas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\\n_retaining_ them, is less certain.\"\\n\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\\nhis dancing and his partner.\\n\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\\nher sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\\nflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\\nwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\n\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made\\nme forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\\nWe have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\\nare to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n\\n\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.\"\\n\\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.\\n\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.\"\\n\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\nsilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\\nfor in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards\\nher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\nanother.\\n\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\\nwith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\n\\n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\nquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\\nhis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\\nMr. Darcy\\'s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\\ngive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s\\nusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\\nalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\\nI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\\ncannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\\nthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\\nthe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\\nout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\\nthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\\nElizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\\nthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\\n\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much mistaken\\nif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\nWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\nthe probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\\'s,\\nMr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\\nbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\n\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\nsatisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\\n\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\nhim _conditionally_ only.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\\n\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\nBingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"\\n\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\nto make a most important discovery.\\n\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\\nin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\nthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\\nCatherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\\ndo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\\nas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\\nit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\nside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\nceased speaking, replied thus:\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\\nyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\\nunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\\ndifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\\nand those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\\nI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\\nthe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\\nfollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\\nperform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\\nprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\nguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\\neducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\\nlady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\\nastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\\nhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\\nit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\\nwords \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It vexed\\nher to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\\nwith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\\nto speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\\nwas not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\\'s contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\n\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\\nthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\\ncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\\nendeavouring even to like Bingley\\'s two sisters. Her mother\\'s thoughts\\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\\nopenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\\nbe married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\\nseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\\nmatch. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\\nthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\\ndaughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\nchance of it.\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\\'s\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\nwhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\nso doing!\"\\n\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\nsteady gravity.\\n\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\\nchicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\ntranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\\nshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\\nbut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\\'s\\neyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\\nprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\\nill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\\nof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\\nfavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\\nMary\\'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\\nweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\\nBingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\\nof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\nimperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\nand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\\nextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\\nyoung ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\n\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\\'s speech, was afraid\\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\\nto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\\nsuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\\nespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\\nhim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\nfamily.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\\nbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\\nsmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\\nwife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\\nand observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\\nclever, good kind of young man.\\n\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\\nand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\\nhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\\nHe assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\nthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\\'s conversation to herself.\\n\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further notice;\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\nit.\\n\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\\na manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\\nan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\\nhow tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\\naddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\\nwould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\\nthe ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\\nand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\\nher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\\nday for a short time.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\\nthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\nobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On\\nfinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\\nsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\n\\n\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\ncourse of this morning?\"\\n\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy\\nwill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I\\nwant you up stairs.\" And, gathering her work together, she was hastening\\naway, when Elizabeth called out:\\n\\n\"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\\ngoing away myself.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\" And upon\\nElizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\\nescape, she added: \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\n\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment\\'s\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\\nconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\\ndistress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\\nthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\\nmother\\'s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the\\npurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\\nmy future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\nsubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\n\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could\\nnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,\\nand he continued:\\n\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\\nadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\\nto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\nleft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said, \\'Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\\na gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\\nand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\\nrespect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\ncan assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\\nbe for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\\nI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\\'s\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\\ndecline them.\"\\n\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\nhand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\\nthird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\ncould make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\nsituation.\"\\n\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\\nvery gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\\nseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\\nmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\nof believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\\nbe considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she\\nthus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\\naddressed her:\\n\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\\nthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\nfemale character.\"\\n\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\nto convince you of its being one.\"\\n\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\\nbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\\nunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\\nwith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\nportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\\nI shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\nfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\\nthe truth from her heart.\"\\n\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\nbeing acceptable.\"\\n\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\\nno reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\\nhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\nin such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\\nthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\nand could not help saying so.\\n\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very\\nheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\\n_make_ her know it.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if\\nshe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not\\nto force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\n\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\nhusband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you\\nare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make\\nLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you\\ndo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\\nher communication.\\n\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\\n\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\"\\n\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\\nmarrying him.\"\\n\\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\nif you _do_.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,\\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to\\n_insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\npresent occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.\"\\n\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane\\nin her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\\n\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin\\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\ndeserving her mother\\'s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\nher, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such\\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\n\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\\nfamily. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone,\\n\"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,\\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned\\nas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\\nshe can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it\\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\nto maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep\\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\\nis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\n\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the\\nirritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of\\nthem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with\\nan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to\\nthe girls, \"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold\\nyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation\\ntogether.\"\\n\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected\\nconversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.\\nFar be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\\ndispleasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation\\nto inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a\\nyoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;\\nand I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt\\nof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;\\nfor I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as\\nwhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\nestimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect\\nto your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to\\nyour daughter\\'s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my\\nbehalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\\ndismission from your daughter\\'s lips instead of your own. But we are all\\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_\\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end, and\\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her\\nmother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\\nexpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\\nbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke\\nto her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\nespecially to her friend.\\n\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour or ill\\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\\nSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham\\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\\naunt\\'s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was\\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not meet\\nMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"\\n\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full\\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly\\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\\nher. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\\ncompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\\nfrom Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,\\nhot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair, flowing hand; and\\nElizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change as she read it, and saw\\nher dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected\\nherself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual\\ncheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety\\non the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\nsooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\ninvited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,\\nJane, taking out the letter, said:\\n\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good\\ndeal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\ntheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You\\nshall hear what she says.\"\\n\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\nand of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a\\nhouse. The next was in these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything\\nI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\\nbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved\\ncorrespondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these highflown\\nexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\\nand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw\\nnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to\\nregard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\"\\n\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are\\nalready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my\\ndearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of\\nthat I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\nabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\\nbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the\\nthree of whom we shall deprive you.\"\\n\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\\nwinter.\"\\n\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\"\\n\\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\\nmaster. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\\n_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think\\nGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\\nand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\\nher relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister\\'s\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman\\'s heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?\"\\n\\n\"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said Jane as she\\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that\\nCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is\\nperfectly convinced of her brother\\'s indifference; and that if she\\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\\n\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him\\nto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.\"\\n\\nJane shook her head.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She\\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\\ncase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\nthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\\nI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\\nherself.\"\\n\\n\"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?\"\\n\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\\nall means to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling. \"You must know that\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.\"\\n\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\\n\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\n\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\\'s\\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of everyone.\\n\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\n\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\'s conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\\nconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\\nbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\nfull courses.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the\\nchief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \"It keeps him in good\\nhumour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\"\\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\\nvery amiable, but Charlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\nhad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them towards\\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and appearances were so\\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\nsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\\nsoon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\ncharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\ntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\\nHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\nthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\\nand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\nestablishment were gained.\\n\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\\'s present\\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\\nMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\\nshould make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole family, in short,\\nwere properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\\nof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\\ndone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s\\ndying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\\nin general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\\nnor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\\nbe imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\\neither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\\nthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\\nand however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\npreservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\\nthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\\nthe good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business\\nwas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\\nshe valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\\nand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\\nto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\nquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\npublish his prosperous love.\\n\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\\nfamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\\nfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\\nsaid how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\\nhis engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\npossible.\"\\n\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\nso speedy a return, immediately said:\\n\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation here, my\\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\noffending your patroness.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\nmaterial a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\\nregard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\\nmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\\ntake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\\ncousin Elizabeth.\"\\n\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\nsurprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\\nunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\\nyounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\\na solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\\nand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying himself in love with her\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\\npossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\nshe could not help crying out:\\n\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"\\n\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\nher composure, and calmly replied:\\n\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\\'s good opinion,\\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\\nfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\\ntheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\\nall imaginable happiness.\\n\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must be surprised,\\nvery much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\\nyou. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s\\ncharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\nentering the marriage state.\"\\n\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an awkward pause,\\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\\nIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers\\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of matrimony was\\nnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\\nand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\\nwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\nchosen.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention\\nit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to\\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\nhouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but\\nincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\\nprotested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\n\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good breeding carried\\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\nmost forbearing courtesy.\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\\nhappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\\nElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\\nherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\nconsole and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\\ncould at all forgive their daughter.\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\\nmore foolish than his daughter!\\n\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty\\nand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\\nto spread at Meryton.\\n\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort\\non Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\\nthough Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\\nenough to drive happiness away.\\n\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\\nno real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,\\nas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\\nreturn.\\n\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to\\ntheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\\ntwelvemonth\\'s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\\nthe happiest of men.\\n\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\\nthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\nabsence.\\n\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\\nfalsehood.\\n\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as\\nshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s happiness, and so\\ndishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\\nfrequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\\nDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for\\nthe strength of his attachment.\\n\\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\\npainful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of\\nconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,\\nan hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\\ndid not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\\nall Jane\\'s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\ntranquillity.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\\nand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight\\nof Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\\nmake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"\\n\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of\\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\n\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\n\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\n\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\ninsensibility.\"\\n\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\\'s own\\ndaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\"\\n\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret at not having had\\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\\nthe country.\\n\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest\\nof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy\\'s praise occupied\\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an\\ninmate of Mr. Darcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\\n\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\\nfor her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline\\'s\\nassertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\nto the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\\nbeen the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\\nwhatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s was involved in it, as\\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,\\non which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\\ncould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really\\ndied away, or were suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether\\nhe had been aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\\nmaterially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s situation remained\\nthe same, her peace equally wounded.\\n\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them together, after a\\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\\nnot help saying:\\n\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no\\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But\\nI will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\\nall be as we were before.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you have\\nno reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\nacquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,\\nand nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A\\nlittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\\n\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness\\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say\\nto you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\\ndeserve.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\\nthe praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want\\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not\\nbe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\\nof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\nsense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the\\nother is Charlotte\\'s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is\\nunaccountable!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference\\nof situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\\'s respectability, and\\nCharlotte\\'s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a\\nlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\\nready to believe, for everybody\\'s sake, that she may feel something like\\nregard and esteem for our cousin.\"\\n\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\\ndanger security for happiness.\"\\n\\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied\\nJane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy\\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\\nit does.\"\\n\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\n\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\\n\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to design,\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\\nunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\\nwant of attention to other people\\'s feelings, and want of resolution,\\nwill do the business.\"\\n\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\\nI think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\"\\n\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\\nsecure it.\"\\n\\n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\\nhappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\\nconnections, and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane;\\n\"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\\nthey should have opposed their brother\\'s. What sister would think\\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\\nto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\nmistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what\\nI should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in\\nthe best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\\'s\\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\\nmore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\\nfor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with\\nless perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she\\ndid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the\\neffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her\\nno more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said he one day,\\n\"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to\\nbeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.\\nIt is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction\\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in\\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\\nbe _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\\nall expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that whatever of\\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make\\nthe most of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\\npleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\\nhad known anything of the matter.\\n\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be\\nany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society\\nof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else\\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 25\\n\\n\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\\nside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason\\nto hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would\\nbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his\\nrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\\ncousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another\\nletter of thanks.\\n\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving\\nher brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas\\nat Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived\\nby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\nwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the\\ntwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\\ndone she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\\ngirls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was\\nnothing in it.\\n\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr.\\nBingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think\\nthat she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time, had it not\\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\\na daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just\\nas much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,\\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\\nlong sleeves.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,\\nin the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence with her, made her\\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\\nconversation.\\n\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It\\nseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\" said she. \"I am\\nsorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such\\nas you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\\nfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\\nher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\n\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will not\\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\\nlove with only a few days before.\"\\n\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s acquaintance,\\nas to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley\\'s\\nlove?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\\noffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I\\nspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be\\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she\\nwould be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\\nof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\\nanything.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\\nof her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to\\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\\nout so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\\nunless he really comes to see her.\"\\n\\n\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\\na part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\\nperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\\nwould hardly think a month\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\\nnever stirs without him.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\"\\n\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\n\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s being\\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\\nhis affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\\'s\\nattractions.\\n\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and the\\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she\\nhoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house with her brother,\\nshe might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\\nseeing him.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,\\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\\nmade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\\non these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,\\nfrom what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and\\nshe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\\nan attachment.\\n\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very\\npart of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\\nacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since\\nthe death of Darcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\nprocuring.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\ncharacter perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject\\nof discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute\\ndescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\\npraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both\\nhim and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s\\ntreatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s\\nreputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and\\nwas confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam\\nDarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 26\\n\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given\\non the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after\\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\\n\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\\nyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want\\nof fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\\n_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\"\\n\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\\ncan prevent it.\"\\n\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with\\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\\nof it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\\'s opinion of me does\\nme the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\\nsince we see every day that where there is affection, young people\\nare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\\nof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it\\nwould be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\nto be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\nobject. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,\\nI will do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\\noften. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\"\\n\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \"very\\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother\\'s ideas as to the\\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\\nyou are satisfied.\"\\n\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for\\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice\\nbeing given on such a point, without being resented.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\\nhis arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was\\nnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think\\nit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that\\nshe \"_wished_ they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be the wedding day,\\nand on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s ungracious and\\nreluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her\\nout of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:\\n\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ you certainly shall.\"\\n\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\"\\n\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\\ncome to Hunsford.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\\nvisit.\\n\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added Charlotte, \"and I\\nhope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as\\nwelcome as either of them.\"\\n\\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\\nthe church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on\\nthe subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their\\ncorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that\\nit should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\\nand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\\nsake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\\'s first letters\\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was most\\nfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of Hunsford and\\nRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\nfor her own visit there to know the rest.\\n\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\\ngenerally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or\\nhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\\nher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\\nlost.\\n\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of the\\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\"\\n\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\\n\"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very\\nglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\\nto London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached\\nher. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\\nengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\\nsee them soon here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in town.\\n\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\\nblind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\\nthe alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\\nlonger. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\nprove what she felt.\\n\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\\nbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\\nentirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me. But, my dear sister,\\nthough the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\\nstill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\\nas natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\\nwishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\\nhappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\\nreturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\\nreceive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\\nshe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\\nin every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\\nperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\\nthough I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\\nas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\\nher side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\\nwrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\\ncause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\\nthis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\\naccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\\nhis sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\namiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\\nbecause, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\\nHe knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said\\nherself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\\nwanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\\ncannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\\nbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\\nin all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\\nand think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\\nsoon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\\nagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\\nnot mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\\nfrom our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\nMaria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\"\\n\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she\\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\\neven wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\\nevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s account, she would make him abundantly\\nregret what he had thrown away.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\\nhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\\nin Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\\nsincerely wish him happy.\\n\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the\\ncircumstances, she thus went on: \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that\\nI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure\\nand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\\nwish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\\ntowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\\nthink her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love\\nwith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the\\nways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 27\\n\\n\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\\ndiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan\\nand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\\nas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\\na peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte\\'s first sketch. She was\\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement\\nof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\nperfect as plan could be.\\n\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of\\nwhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\\nwas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,\\nwhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\\nand pleasing.\\n\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\nthink him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\\nshe had known Sir William\\'s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\\nworn out, like his information.\\n\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\\'s\\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\\nthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\\nwhose eagerness for their cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to\\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\\nher for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her\\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,\\nto hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\\'s desertion, and\\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King? I\\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get\\na girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\\nmercenary.\"\\n\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\\nwhat to think.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\"\\n\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s death\\nmade her mistress of this fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\naffections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\\npoor?\"\\n\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her\\nso soon after this event.\"\\n\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\\nwhy should _we_?\"\\n\\n\"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow\\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\\nneither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\\nworth knowing, after all.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\\n\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\\n\"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\n\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \"Oh, my dear,\\ndear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight! what felicity! You\\ngive me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What\\nare young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport\\nwe shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other\\ntravellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We\\n_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.\\nLakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\\nimaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,\\nwill we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_\\nfirst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of\\ntravellers.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 28\\n\\n\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting to\\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\\nThe palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\\ncoming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\\ninstantly that her cousin\\'s manners were not altered by his marriage;\\nhis formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\\nwere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\\nformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\\'s\\noffers of refreshment.\\n\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\\nin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\\naspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\\nas if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\\nthough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\\ngratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\\nher friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\\nWhen Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\\neye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\\nin general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\\nadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\\nthe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\\nwhich he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\\nprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\\nthe park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\\nmodern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband\\'s\\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\\nCharlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\\nforgotten.\\n\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\\nin, observed:\\n\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\\nwhen service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\\nwill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\\nto walk home. Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\\n_should_ say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has several.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added\\nCharlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\n\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\\nand telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\\nCharlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\\nwould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\\nRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\\nup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\\nthe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\\nagitation, cried out--\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\\nhaste, and come down this moment.\"\\n\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\\nand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\\nquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\\ngarden gate.\\n\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs\\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter.\"\\n\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not\\nLady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\\nthe other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\\ncreature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\"\\n\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\\nWhy does she not come in?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\\nwhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\n\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\\nmake him a very proper wife.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high diversion, was\\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\\nway.\\n\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\\nto dine at Rosings the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 29\\n\\n\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\\nof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\\nCatherine\\'s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by\\nher ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at\\nRosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\\nwould happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who\\ncould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\\n(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\\nafter your arrival!\"\\n\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir William,\\n\"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\\n\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\\n\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\\nbecomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\\nfor being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\\npreserved.\"\\n\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\\nher ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\\nwho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\\nto his presentation at St. James\\'s.\\n\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\nmile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\n\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was every\\nmoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\\nElizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\\nshe could witness without trepidation.\\n\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\\nfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\\nCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\\nwith great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\\nsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\\nbe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\\napologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\\n\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s, Sir William was so completely\\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\\nsilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\\nas marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\\n\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her\\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\nher eyes.\\n\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\\nlooking at in the summer.\\n\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\\nall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\\nlikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\\nladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\\nnothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\\ngave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\\na novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\\nbetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\\ndinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\\nMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\\nshe was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\\ngentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\\nbe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\\nsubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\\nhave her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic\\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\\nbeneath this great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\noccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\\nthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\\npretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\\nher mother\\'s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\\nher questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\\nobserved,\\n\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\\nsake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\\nBennet?\"\\n\\n\"A little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\n\\n\"One of them does.\"\\n\\n\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\\nyou draw?\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\n\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\n\\n\"Not one.\"\\n\\n\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\\n\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\\n\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\n\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\n\\n\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\\nhave been quite a slave to your education.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been\\nthe case.\\n\\n\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\\nmust have been neglected.\"\\n\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\\nidle, certainly might.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\\nwho was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s\\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \\'Lady\\nCatherine,\\' said she, \\'you have given me a treasure.\\' Are any of your\\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\n\\n\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\\nyounger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\\nmust be very young?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\\nmuch in company. But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be very hard upon\\nyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\\nmarry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly\\nfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\"\\n\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth, smiling, \"your\\nladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\\nconceal your age.\"\\n\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables\\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\\nexpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or\\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\\nfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\\nand noble names.\\n\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\\ngratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\\nthe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed. As soon\\nas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\\nto give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\\nCharlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\\ncommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\\nMr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise\\ninto his own hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 30\\n\\n\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\\nenough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most comfortably settled,\\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\\nmorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\\nreading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\\nElizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\\nthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\\nmore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\nmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\\nalong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\\nhad a few minutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\n\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\\nof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\\nout that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\\nby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\\nbe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\\nthem into harmony and plenty.\\n\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\\nin the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins\\'s reach. This,\\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\\ncomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\\nfrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\n\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\\nexpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\\nmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs on him\\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\\ndestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\\nMiss Lucas and herself.\\n\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\\nin order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\\nbow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\\nintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\\nrespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\\nhis uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\\nMr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\\nthem from her husband\\'s room, crossing the road, and immediately running\\ninto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\n\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\n\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\\nused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\\ncurtseyed to him without saying a word.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\\nway, and after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\n\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\\nhappened to see her there?\"\\n\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\\nthe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\\nsubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 31\\n\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures\\nof their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\\nreceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the\\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\\nalmost a week after the gentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by\\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\\nof Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the\\nParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\\nonly at church.\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\\nthe party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room. Her ladyship received\\nthem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a\\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s pretty friend had\\nmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\\nspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,\\nas well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a\\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\\nscruple to call out:\\n\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\\n\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid\\na reply.\\n\\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\\nmust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\\nof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,\\nI should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\\nhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\\ndelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s proficiency.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel\\nif she does not practice a good deal.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\\nShe practises very constantly.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\\ntell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\\nwill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\nJenkinson\\'s room. She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in that part\\nof the house.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and made\\nno answer.\\n\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away\\nfrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s\\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\\nconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\n\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\\nme? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There\\nis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the\\nwill of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could not\\nreally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have\\nhad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find\\ngreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are\\nnot your own.\"\\n\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\\nin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\\nof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\\ncredit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\\nthat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\\nsay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\\nthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\n\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\n\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\\nFitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\\n\\n\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\\nThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\\nwas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\\nonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\\nknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a\\npartner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\\n\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\\nbeyond my own party.\"\\n\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an\\nintroduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\\nhimself to strangers?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\\n\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\\nconcerns, as I often see done.\"\\n\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\\nmasterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do. They have not the same\\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\\ntrouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\\ncapable as any other woman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\n\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\\nto Darcy:\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\\'s. Anne would have\\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\\ncousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\\nde Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\\n\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s performance, mixing\\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\\nthem with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the\\ngentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was\\nready to take them all home.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 32\\n\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane\\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to\\nbe Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\\nhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\\nwhen the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and\\nMr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\n\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\\nintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were\\nto be within.\\n\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and\\nfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\\ndeparture, she observed:\\n\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\n\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short\\npause added:\\n\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\\nreturning to Netherfield again?\"\\n\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\\nvery little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and\\nis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\\nincreasing.\"\\n\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same\\nprinciple.\"\\n\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up as\\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\\n\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable\\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\\nCollins first came to Hunsford.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\nkindness on a more grateful object.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one\\nof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the\\nwisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\\nprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\\n\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\n\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\n\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\\'s\\njourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\"\\n\\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\\nof the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins\\nwas settled _near_ her family.\"\\n\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\n\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of\\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\\nthe present distance.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\\nbeen always at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and\\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\n\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\n\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\\nand her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\\nthem. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\\non Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\\nmuch to anybody, went away.\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\\ngone. \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\\nhave called us in this familiar way.\"\\n\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\\neven to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after various\\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\\nalways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners,\\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind.\\n\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\\nit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\\nto propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\\nFitzwilliam\\'s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\nher; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\\nof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\\nseriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\\'s dislike would\\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n\\n\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 33\\n\\n\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to\\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\\nit was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about\\nher pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and that in speaking of\\nRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\npales opposite the Parsonage.\\n\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\\'s last letter,\\nand dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in\\nspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw\\non looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the\\nletter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\\n\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\n\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I generally\\ndo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\\nyou going much farther?\"\\n\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\n\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\\narranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\\npleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\\nthan many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\\ndependence.\"\\n\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\\neither. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\\nwherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\\n\\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\\nweight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\\nthey like.\"\\n\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\\ndo.\"\\n\\n\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\\nin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what\\nis the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\\nshe soon afterwards said:\\n\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\\nhaving someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\\nfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\\nlikes with her.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\\ncharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\\nlittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\\nmay like to have her own way.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\\n\\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\\n\\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\\nis a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\n\\n\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\\nour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\\nhim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\\nBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\n\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\\nbecause if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it would be an\\nunpleasant thing.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\n\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\\nhim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\n\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\\nlady.\"\\n\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\n\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \"He\\nonly told me what I have now told you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\\nwas so thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\\ncousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\\n\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\n\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\\nfriend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\\ndetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\\nBut,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\\nthat there was much affection in the case.\"\\n\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\n\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\\nmatters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\\ntaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\\nalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\\nof them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\\nthe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\\nsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\\nevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\\nworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel\\nFitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections probably were, her\\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\\nbusiness in London.\\n\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of\\nobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding\\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither\\ncould anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\\npeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and\\nrespectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought of\\nher mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\\nthat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\\nimportance in his friend\\'s connections, than from their want of sense;\\nand she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\\nby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\\nBingley for his sister.\\n\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to\\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 34\\n\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\\nas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy\\'s\\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\\na keener sense of her sister\\'s sufferings. It was some consolation\\nto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\\nnext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\\nherself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of\\nher spirits, by all that affection could do.\\n\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without remembering that\\nhis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\\nthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\\nmean to be unhappy about him.\\n\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\\ndoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\\nBut this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\\nroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\\nthen getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:\\n\\n\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\\nyou.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;\\nand the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,\\nimmediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\\nthose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\\nsubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\\nopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\\nthe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\\nsuit.\\n\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\\nthe compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her intentions did\\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\\nlost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\\nof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\\nhis hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\\nof a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\\nhis countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\\nonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\\ncheeks, and she said:\\n\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\\nbe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\\nof short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed\\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\\nof his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings\\ndreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\n\\n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\\nI might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\\n\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a desire\\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\\nyou--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\\nthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\\nbeloved sister?\"\\n\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\\ncontinued:\\n\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\\nyou cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\\nof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\\nworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\\nkind.\"\\n\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\n\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of denying\\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\\nkinder than towards myself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\\nis founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\n\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said Darcy,\\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\\ninterest in him?\"\\n\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\\nhave been great indeed.\"\\n\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\\nhim to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\\nwithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\\nhim. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\\nwhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\\nand yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\\nridicule.\"\\n\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\\n\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\\nI thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in\\nhis walk, and turning towards her, \"these offenses might have been\\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\\nmy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\\njust. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\\nwhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\\ngentlemanlike manner.\"\\n\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\n\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\\nwould have tempted me to accept it.\"\\n\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\\n\\n\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\\nmy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\\nthe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\\ndisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\n\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\\nwishes for your health and happiness.\"\\n\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\n\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\\nto support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\\nhalf-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\\nwas increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\\nmarriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\\nso many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\\nall the objections which had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying\\nher sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\\nown case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\\nunconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\\npride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\\nJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\\nnot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\\nWickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\\novercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\\na moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\\nsound of Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\\nencounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 35\\n\\n\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\\nbreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\\nshe turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\\nof the gates into the ground.\\n\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\\nDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\\nher name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\\nin a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\\ngate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\\nwhich she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\\n\"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\\nWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\n\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\\nfrom Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\\n\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\\nof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\\noffers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\\ndemand it of your justice.\\n\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\\nfrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\\npersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\\nto be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\\nand their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\\nis due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\\nmay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\\nmust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\n\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\\nothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\\nwoman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\\nat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\\nattachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\\nhad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\\nWilliam Lucas\\'s accidental information, that Bingley\\'s attentions to\\nyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\\nHe spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\\nbe undecided. From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour\\nattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\\nBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\\nwatched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\\nbut without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\\nfrom the evening\\'s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\\nwith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\\nsentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\\nin error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\\nprobable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\\npain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\\nscruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and\\nair was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\neasily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\\ncertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\\nare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\\nher to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\\nconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\\nmarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\\nthe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\\nconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\\nthere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\\nexisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\\nmyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\\nme. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\\ntotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\\nherself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\\nfather. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\\nfor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\\nhave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\\nis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\\nit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\\nfarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\\nwas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\\nme before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\nconnection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\\nyou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\\n\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters\\' uneasiness\\nhad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\\nsoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\\ndetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\\nLondon. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\\nof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\\ndescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\\nmight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\\nseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\\nsister\\'s indifference. He had before believed her to return his\\naffection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\\nnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\\nown. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\\nno very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\\nHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\\nwork of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\\nis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\\nreflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\\nmeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in\\ntown. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\\nbrother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\\nill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\\nenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\\nconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\\nwas done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\\nother apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister\\'s feelings, it\\nwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\\nyou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\nthem.\\n\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured\\nMr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his\\nconnection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\\nam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more\\nthan one witness of undoubted veracity.\\n\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many\\nyears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good\\nconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to\\nbe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\\nkindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\\nschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his\\nown father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\\nbeen unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education. My father was not only\\nfond of this young man\\'s society, whose manners were always engaging; he\\nhad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\\nhis profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is\\nmany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different\\nmanner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was\\ncareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\\nand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\\nDarcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree\\nyou only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham\\nhas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from\\nunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.\\n\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to\\nMr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\\nrecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\\nthat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\\nvaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\\nwas also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\\nwrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\\nhe hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\\nimmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\\ncould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\\nlaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\\nbe a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\\nhim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\\nhis proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\\nbusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\\nlived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\\nfrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\\nFor about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\\nincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\\nme again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\\nme, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\\nhad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\\nquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\\nwell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\\nhave forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions. You will hardly blame\\nme for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\\nrepetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\\nhis circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\\nto others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\\nappearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\\nlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\n\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,\\nand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold\\nto any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your\\nsecrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to\\nthe guardianship of my mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\\nAbout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\\nfor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\\nover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\\ndesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\\nand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\\nby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\\nwhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\\nher as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\\nto consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\\nexcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed\\nthe knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\\nbefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\\na father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\\nhow I acted. Regard for my sister\\'s credit and feelings prevented\\nany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\\nimmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\\nWickham\\'s chief object was unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which\\nis thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\\nrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have\\nbeen complete indeed.\\n\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have\\nbeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as\\nfalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\\nWickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he\\nhad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered\\nat. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,\\ndetection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in\\nyour inclination.\\n\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but\\nI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to\\nbe revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more\\nparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our\\nnear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\\nthe executors of my father\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted\\nwith every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_\\nshould make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by\\nthe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be\\nthe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\\nopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the\\nmorning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n\\n\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 36\\n\\n\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\\nits contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly\\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what\\nhad happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly\\nleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the\\nnext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of\\nthe one before her eyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she\\ninstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst\\nobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing\\nhim justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied\\nher; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\\ninsolence.\\n\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,\\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her\\nfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"--and when she had\\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what\\nhe had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though\\nshe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\nwords. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the\\nwill, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\\nwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\\nnot err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the\\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions\\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down\\nthe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read\\non; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\\nrender Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at\\nMr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\\nentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\\npersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life\\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As\\nto his real character, had information been in her power, she had\\nnever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried\\nto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\\nintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of\\nMr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\\ncasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy\\nhad described as the idleness and vice of many years\\' continuance. But\\nno such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\\nher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\\nsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\\npausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\\nread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss\\nDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\\nFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\\nreferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\\nhimself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\\nnear concern in all his cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no\\nreason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\\nat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\\nhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\\ncousin\\'s corroboration.\\n\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\\nbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\\'s.\\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\\nthe very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield\\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\\nherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;\\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s\\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\\nalways prevent his exposing the son.\\n\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\\nHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\\nand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\\nof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\nesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\nsister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his\\nactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\\nthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\\nas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\n\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\\ncould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,\\nabsurd.\\n\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided myself\\non my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified\\nmy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this\\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could\\nnot have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my\\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were\\nconcerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\n\\nFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s explanation\\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely\\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\\ncredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\\ngive in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\\nsister\\'s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s\\nopinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\\ndescription of Jane. She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent, were\\nlittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air\\nand manner not often united with great sensibility.\\n\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\\nthan on hers.\\n\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,\\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been\\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered\\nthat Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\\nhad ever known before.\\n\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\nvariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,\\nand reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\\nso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\\nher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\\nof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\\nreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\\n\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\\nleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern\\nin missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\\nlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 37\\n\\n\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having\\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very\\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\\nhastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,\\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\\nhaving them all to dine with her.\\n\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as\\nher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\\nladyship\\'s indignation would have been. \"What would she have said? how\\nwould she have behaved?\" were questions with which she amused herself.\\n\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \"I assure\\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe no one\\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\\nattached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to\\nme! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The\\ndear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\\nseemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His\\nattachment to Rosings certainly increases.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which\\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\\nspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that\\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:\\n\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that\\nyou may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\\ncompany, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\" replied\\nElizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\\nnext Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\\nspare you for another fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters\\nare never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay\\nanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as\\nfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as\\nDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room\\nfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\n\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\noriginal plan.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. \"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in\\nthe world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of\\nMr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I\\nam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\"\\n\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\\nhave somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?\\nOh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\\nattended to.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\\nand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\\nwhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\\noccupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be\\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary\\nwalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\\nrecollections.\\n\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\\nshe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\\'s indulgence,\\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\nirritable, and completely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always\\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there\\nforever.\\n\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy\\'s\\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved\\nto have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\\nrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n\\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham\\'s\\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\\nseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\\nher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\\nthere; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\n\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\\nand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her\\nhand to both.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 38\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has yet\\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\\nit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We\\nknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\\nmanner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we\\nsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\\nand that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending\\nyour time unpleasantly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She\\nhad spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\\nCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_\\nfeel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling\\nsolemnity replied:\\n\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not\\ndisagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately\\nhaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,\\nfrom our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the\\nhumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford\\nvisit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to\\nLady Catherine\\'s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage\\nand blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You\\nsee how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\\nthat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should\\nnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are\\nsharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\n\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\\nand truth in a few short sentences.\\n\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will\\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\\nother.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.\\nPoor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she\\nhad chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that\\nher visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her\\nhome and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their\\ndependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\\nplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\\nMr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her\\nwith his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her\\nin, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\\nwhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.\\n\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble respects\\ndelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\\nwhile you have been here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and\\nthe carriage drove off.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it seems\\nbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\\nhappened!\"\\n\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\n\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\\nHow much I shall have to tell!\"\\n\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to conceal!\"\\n\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner\\'s\\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days.\\n\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\\nspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her\\naunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\n\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\\nLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s proposals. To know\\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\\nto openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision\\nin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;\\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried\\ninto repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\\nfurther.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 39\\n\\n\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\\ntogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\\nand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\\'s carriage\\nwas to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\\'s\\npunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.\\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\\nin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\\ndressing a salad and cucumber.\\n\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\\nout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\\n\"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\n\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must lend us the\\nmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\" Then, showing\\nher purchases--\"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think\\nit is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\\nare going in a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\\ntake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;\\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\\ngo too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\\nhave!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,\\nand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole\\ncampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\\nregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\"\\n\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat down at\\ntable. \"What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about\\na certain person we all like!\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need\\nnot stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\\n\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\\nmy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\\nThere is no danger of Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King. There\\'s for you! She\\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\"\\n\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection\\nimprudent as to fortune.\"\\n\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\\nthree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled\\nthing?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\\nwas little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!\\n\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\\nboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\\'s and\\nLydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\n\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia. \"I am glad I bought my\\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now\\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\\nhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not\\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\\nget husbands, you can\\'t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\\nhow I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\\nchaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster\\'s. Kitty and me were to spend\\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\\nevening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on purpose to pass for a\\nlady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\\nForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\\n\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\n\\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\n\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that\\noccupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and\\npoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one\\nhand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat\\nsome way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\\'s,\\nwas enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\\nwould hear her.\\n\\n\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\\nAs we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there\\nwas nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty\\nhad not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved\\nvery handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\\nluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated\\nyou too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\\nshould have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then\\nwe were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that\\nanybody might have heard us ten miles off!\"\\n\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\\nto depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the\\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\\n_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\\n\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk\\nto Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily\\nopposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could\\nnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\\nThere was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\\nWickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\\ncomfort to _her_ of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped\\nthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton\\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 40\\n\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could\\nno longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every\\nparticular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be\\nsurprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene\\nbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\\nnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\\nunhappiness which her sister\\'s refusal must have given him.\\n\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and certainly\\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\\ndisappointment!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\\nother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\\n\\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\\n\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\n\\n\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\\n\\n\"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next\\nday.\"\\n\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\\nas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!\\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\\ncollected in one individual. Nor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though\\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\\nseek to clear the one without involving the other.\\n\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to make both\\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s;\\nbut you shall do as you choose.\"\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so\\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only\\nconsider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the\\nknowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing\\nof his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it\\nso.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so\\nfull of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\\ngrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion\\nmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\\nbe as light as a feather.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\n\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\\nappearance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\\nused to do.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\\'s genius, such an\\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing\\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\\nthe matter as you do now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And\\nwith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say\\nthat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I\\nhad! Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\n\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\\nundeserved.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There\\nis one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand\\nWickham\\'s character.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can be no\\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\"\\n\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\\nto make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\\nis so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\\nMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal\\nto it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\nanyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\\nand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At\\npresent I will say nothing about it.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\\n\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\\ngot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,\\nand was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish\\nto talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\\nof which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\\nhalf of Mr. Darcy\\'s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\\nhad been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\\nunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off\\nthis last encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\\nimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to\\ntell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The\\nliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\n\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\\nstate of her sister\\'s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\\nvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself\\nin love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,\\nand, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first\\nattachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\\nand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her\\nattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the\\nindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own\\nhealth and their tranquillity.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion _now_ of\\nthis sad business of Jane\\'s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\\nof it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But\\nI cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is\\na very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there\\'s the least\\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of\\nhis coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\\neverybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\n\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\\nshall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I\\nwould not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will\\ndie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\\n\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,\\nshe made no answer.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so the\\nCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\\nit will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\\nexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\\nmother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\\nhousekeeping, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will\\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\\nfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as\\nquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\n\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\n\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they\\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be\\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 41\\n\\n\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\\nthe last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies\\nin the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\" would they\\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so,\\nLizzy?\"\\n\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years\\nago.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel\\nMiller\\'s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall break _mine_,\" said Lydia.\\n\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\\ndisagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\n\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\"\\nadded Kitty.\\n\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\nobjections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his\\ninterference in the views of his friend.\\n\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\\nreceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of\\nthe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour\\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\\ntheir _three_ months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\n\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\\nto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\\'s feelings, Lydia\\nflew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\\'s\\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate\\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\"\\nsaid she, \"Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\\nher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\\nconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense\\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\\ngo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\\'s general\\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\\nbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\\n\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so\\nlittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\\ncircumstances.\"\\n\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to\\nus all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\\'s unguarded and\\nimprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\\nwould judge differently in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away\\nsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\\nsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\\nare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who\\nhave been kept aloof by Lydia\\'s folly.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\\nof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\\nimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\\nLydia\\'s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\\nwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\\nof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\\nKitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\\ndisgrace?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\\nBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\nmany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest\\nof her life.\"\\n\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on\\nthem. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\\nover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\\ndisposition.\\n\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\\nunited volubility. In Lydia\\'s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\\nShe saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them\\nat present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\\nofficers at once.\\n\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\\nrealities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have\\nbeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\\nLydia\\'s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\\nconviction of her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\n\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia\\'s leaving\\nhome.\\n\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\\nher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\\nand her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\\n\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he dined,\\nwith other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\\ndisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and Mr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three\\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\n\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\\nasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\\nWith an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\\n\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\n\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\n\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And\\npray, may I ask?--\" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \"Is\\nit in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility\\nto his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower\\nand more serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much\\nwhat he ever was.\"\\n\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\nrejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\\nand anxious attention, while she added:\\n\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\\nhis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\\nknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\\n\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\\naccents:\\n\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\\ndeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\\nfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\\nalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\\nopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\\noperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\\nimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\\nam certain he has very much at heart.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\\nside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\\nmutual desire of never meeting again.\\n\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\\nand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which\\nthere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in\\nthe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more\\ngentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 42\\n\\n\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\\nnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic\\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\\nof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views\\nof domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of\\na disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\\nimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\\nfather\\'s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she found little\\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\\nabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and\\nsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around\\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all\\nher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been\\nlooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have\\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish for.\\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\\nsister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\\npleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\\n\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to\\nthe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still\\nless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\\nmuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\\nhumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore\\na happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\\nback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of\\nJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\\ntears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by\\nthe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\\nmention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious\\narrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in\\nMeryton.\\n\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\\napproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\\nwithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so\\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\\npresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\n\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\\nthe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\\nand all was soon right again.\\n\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was\\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\\nowner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I may enter his county with impunity,\\nand rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\n\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\\nbefore her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.\\nand Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\\ncousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\\nnext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\nOne enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;\\na suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\\ndisappointments abroad.\\n\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\\nlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are\\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s\\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\\nstill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\\nprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,\\nElizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not\\nin their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed\\nan inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard\\nso much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so many of your\\nacquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\\nmust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\\nmany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house\\nrichly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but\\nthe grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\\n\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\\nproprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\\nalarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\\nto the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 43\\n\\n\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\\nhalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\\nhigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\\nwonder at her being where she was.\\n\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\\nthey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\nwas a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\\nshe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\\nbanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\\nwith delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\\ndifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\\nseen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\\nthe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\\nhis taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With\\nthese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting\\nherself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\\n\\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\\nregret.\\n\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\\nabsent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\\nwas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\\nReynolds replied that he was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with\\na large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\\njourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\\nlikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\\nover the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\\nThe housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\\ngentleman, the son of her late master\\'s steward, who had been brought\\nup by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\\nreturn it.\\n\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\\n\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\\nother--about eight years ago.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\\nlooking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\\nus whether it is like or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\n\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\n\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\\nmaster\\'s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\\nbe then. He was very fond of them.\"\\n\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among them.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\\nwhen she was only eight years old.\\n\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\naccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\\na new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\\ncomes here to-morrow with him.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\\nby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\\nmaster and his sister.\\n\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\n\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\\n\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\n\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\\ngood enough for him.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\\n\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\"\\nreplied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\\nlistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have\\nnever known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\\nsince he was four years old.\"\\n\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\\nHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\\ngrateful to her uncle for saying:\\n\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\\nhaving such a master.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\\nnot meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\\nhe was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\\nworld.\"\\n\\nElizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\" thought she.\\n\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\\nas affable to the poor.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\\nfurniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\\nprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\\nmany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\\nlived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\\nhim a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\\nanything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\\nlike other young men.\"\\n\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not\\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\n\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\\nlast at Pemberley.\\n\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\\none of the windows.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she should enter\\nthe room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever\\ncan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\\nis nothing he would not do for her.\"\\n\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\\nDarcy\\'s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\\nalso more intelligible.\\n\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\\nthe only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\\nher--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\\nsmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\\nlooked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\\ncontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\\nMrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\nlifetime.\\n\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more gentle\\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\\nconsidered how many people\\'s happiness were in his guardianship!--how\\nmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\\ngood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\\nforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\\neyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\\ngratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.\\n\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\\nthey returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\\n\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\\nwas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\\nsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\\n\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\\nof perfect civility.\\n\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\\'s expression of surprise, on\\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\\nshe returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\\nhe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\\nminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\nher life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\\nhad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\\nto the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\\nDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\\ndistraction of his thoughts.\\n\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\\nleave.\\n\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\\nElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\\nfollowed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\\ncoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\\nworld! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\\nmight it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\\nthrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\\nthus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\\nsooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\\nfor it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\\nfrom his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\\nthe perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\\naltered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\\namazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\\nNever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\\nhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\\na contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\\nhis letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\\nfor it.\\n\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\\nseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\nwas. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\\nseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\\ncomposure.\\n\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\\naroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\\nascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\\nthe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\\nvalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\\nmany, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\\nWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\\nIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\\nbrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\\nto the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\\nit by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\\nit was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\\nvalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\\nElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\\nbridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\\nof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\\nman about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment\\nwas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\\nless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\nthey met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\\nfor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\\nthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\npoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\\nsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\\nPemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\\nand she said no more.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\\nand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\\nacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\\nrevolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\\nshe, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\\nfashion.\"\\n\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\\nit, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\\nconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\\nsome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\\nhis taste, or his good manners.\\n\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\\nchose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\\nto supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\\nwalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\\nElizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\nmust be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\\ncontinually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can\\nit proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\\nmanners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\\nchange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\\n\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\\nthe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\\nin Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\\nElizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\\nher husband\\'s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\\ntogether. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\\nto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\nvery unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\\nin the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\\nwill join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\n\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had been the last\\nmentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\\nmind was not very differently engaged.\\n\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\\npause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\\nduring your stay at Lambton?\"\\n\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\\nmust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\\nhim think really ill of her.\\n\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\\nmile behind.\\n\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\\nthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\\nthat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\\nwith great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\\npatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\\nover. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up they were all pressed to go\\ninto the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\\nthey parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\\nwalking slowly towards the house.\\n\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\\n\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\\n\\n\"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\\nhave seen nothing of it.\"\\n\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\\nor, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for his features\\nare perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\\ndisagreeable?\"\\n\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\\nhim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\\nher uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\\nat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\\nhis grounds.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\\nsaid nothing.\\n\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\\ngood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\\nvirtue.\"\\n\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\\nas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\\nhis relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\\nWickham\\'s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning\\'s walk they\\nhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\\nintercourse renewed after many years\\' discontinuance.\\n\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\\'s civility, and, above\\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 44\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\\narrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\\na curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\\nthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\\nsurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\\nthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\\nquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\\nElizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\\namazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\\nshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\\nin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\\n\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\\nher beyond a monosyllable.\\n\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\\nwas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\\'s quick\\nstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\\nElizabeth\\'s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\\ninquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\\nand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\\neach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\\nwhat it was to love. Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little\\nin doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\\nevident enough.\\n\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\\nfeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\\nto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\n\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\\na like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\\nappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\\nbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\\nshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\\nere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\\nrecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\\nmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\\nto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\\nwhich had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since\\nhe had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply,\\nhe added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\\ngave them meaning.\\n\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\\nbut, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\\nfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\\nshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\\nof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\\ndisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\\nlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\\nso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\\nrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\\ncould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\\nRosings.\\n\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity; it was\\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\\n\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\\nfrom their own feelings and his servant\\'s report, without any reference\\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\\nand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\\nhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\\nthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\\nIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\\nbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\\nacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\\naccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\\nher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\\neager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\\nof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\\nwere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\\non making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\\npride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\\nlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\\nsort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\\nexactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\\nshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\\nbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\\nfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\\nhis addresses.\\n\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to see them on the\\nvery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\\nlate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\\nby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\\nit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 45\\n\\n\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of her had\\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\\nappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\\nmuch civility on that lady\\'s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\\n\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\\nLondon. Georgiana\\'s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\\nall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\\nof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\\nthe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\nshort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\\nBingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\\na significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\\nparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\\nthem round the table.\\n\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\\nregret that he came.\\n\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s, in spite of the\\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s\\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\n\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\\n\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name; but Elizabeth\\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment\\'s distress;\\nbut exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\\npresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\\nhave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\nElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\\nDarcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\\nwith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s\\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s connections\\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\\nwish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\\nfor the welfare of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\n\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\\nBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\\'s person,\\nbehaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\\'s\\nrecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\\nerr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\\nwithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\\nDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\\nhim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she\\ncried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\\nthe winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing\\nthat we should not have known her again.\"\\n\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\\nhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\\nher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\\nsummer.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could\\nsee any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\\nwants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\\nwhich have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\\nnot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.\"\\n\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued:\\n\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \\'_She_\\na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.\\' But afterwards she\\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\\none time.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\\nwas only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have\\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\\n\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\\nboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\\'s\\nbeginning the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 46\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\\non the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\\nit had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\\nher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\\nthemselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\\n\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step\\n(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\\nthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against\\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\\nknow what I have written.\"\\n\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the\\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham\\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\\'s short\\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was\\nrepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.\\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,\\nbut no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that\\nis known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\\nI know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\\nside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\\nthem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\\nwithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\\nthe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\\nfor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\\ndistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\\nworst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\\nit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\\ntheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\\nyoung woman of Lydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\\nher so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his\\nhead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to\\nbe trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she\\nexert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\\nas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\\nanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\\nconfidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\\nfirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\\nso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\\ntake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\\ncircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\\ncome here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\\nthat I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\\nmore to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure\\nI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any\\nmeasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\\nbe at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\\nuncle\\'s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\\nimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing\\na moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\\nmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\\nshe, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation,\\nhastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\\nMr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not\\nan instant to lose.\"\\n\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute;\\nbut let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\\nan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\\nmistress home instantly.\\n\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\\n\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\\n\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\\nsomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\\nsilence. At length she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane,\\nwith such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\\nsister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\\nthe power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\\n_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\\nconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\\n\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added in a yet\\nmore agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\\nhe was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\\nlearnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\\nhave happened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\\n\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked. But is it\\ncertain--absolutely certain?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\\nalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\\nScotland.\"\\n\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\\n\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\\'s\\nimmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\\nnothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\\n\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n\\n\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking\\nup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\\npower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\\nwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\\nup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\\nthe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\\nstay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\\ncould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\nsuch distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\\nseem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\\nfear, prevent my sister\\'s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\\nlong as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\n\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\\nreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\\none serious, parting look, went away.\\n\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\\nhad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\\nof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\\'s\\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\\notherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\\na first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy must\\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\\nbusiness. Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter, had she entertained\\na hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\\nof her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\\nletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\\nWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\\nas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\\nLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\\nof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\\nnor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\n\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\\nfluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\\nfeel it!\\n\\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\\nfamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost\\nimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\\nand Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant\\'s\\naccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\\ninstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\\nsummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\\nof the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a\\nfavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\\nafflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\\nfirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\\nassistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\\nhim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\\neverything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\\nbe off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\"\\ncried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\\nus; was it so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\\n_That_ is all settled.\"\\n\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\\nprepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\n\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 47\\n\\n\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they\\ndrove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\\nform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I\\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\\nnot adequate to the risk!\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle\\'s\\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\\ninterest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\\nWickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\\nhim capable of it?\"\\n\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\nneglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\\ndare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\\nthe case?\"\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\\na presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\\nBarnet road.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\\nexpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\\nfriend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was persuaded of his never intending\\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\\nno brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\\'s\\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\\nsuch a matter.\"\\n\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\\nas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with\\ntears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and virtue in such\\na point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\\nnay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\\nflirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\\neverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\\ngreater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\\nnaturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\n\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very ill of\\nWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\n\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\\ntheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the other day,\\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\\nwith such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\\nand Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\\'s time. As that was the\\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\\nit apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\\nneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\\nsettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\\nin any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\\nconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\\nenough from my thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\n\\n\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\\nthe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth\\'s thoughts it was never absent.\\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\\nno interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\\non the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\\ncomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\\nby long expectations.\\n\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\\non the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\\nfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\\nmother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\n\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\\nheard of the fugitives.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\\neverything will be well.\"\\n\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\n\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\n\\n\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\\nagain till he had something of importance to mention.\"\\n\\n\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\"\\n\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\\nshaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\\nHeaven, are quite well.\"\\n\\n\"But you--how are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you\\nmust have gone through!\"\\n\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\\nof the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of\\ngood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\\'\\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\\nerrors of her daughter must principally be owing.\\n\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to Brighton,\\nwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\\nhad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\\nwell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the\\ncharge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!\\nAnd now here\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,\\nwherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become\\nof us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his\\ngrave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we\\nshall do.\"\\n\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is right to be\\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we\\nmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\\nlost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make\\nhim come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult\\ntogether as to what is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I\\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\\nafter they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my\\nwits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such\\nspasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\\nI can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to\\ngive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\\nnot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I\\nknow you will contrive it all.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well\\nin her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till\\ndinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on\\nthe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\\n\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\\noppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\\nmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\\nbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\\nfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\\nin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\\nwhich she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\\nfretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\\nof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\\n\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\\n\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\\n\"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\\nlesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\\nbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\\n\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed\\nto make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of\\nthe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\\nthe subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\nI have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\\nespecially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\\ngrieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\\n\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\\ntheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\\ninclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\\n\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\n\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt\\na little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with him\\nin marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter\\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\\nbeing in love with each other, many weeks.\"\\n\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\n\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\n\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does\\nhe know his real character?\"\\n\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;\\nbut I hope this may be false.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\\nthis could not have happened!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister. \"But to expose\\nthe former faults of any person without knowing what their present\\nfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\\n\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to his\\nwife?\"\\n\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\n\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\\nwere the contents:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,\\n\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\nlaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\\nmissed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,\\nI shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I\\nlove, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think\\nit no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my\\ngoing, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,\\nwhen I write to them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\' What a good joke\\nit will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to\\nPratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.\\nTell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will\\ndance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall\\nsend for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell\\nSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are\\npacked up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\\ndrink to our good journey.\\n\\n\"Your affectionate friend,\\n\\n\"LYDIA BENNET.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she had\\nfinished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!\\nBut at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their\\njourney. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her\\nside a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\n\\n\"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\\nsuch confusion!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it who\\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to\\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so\\nmuch as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen\\nalmost took from me my faculties.\"\\n\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\\nupon yourself alone.\"\\n\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\\nfatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.\\nKitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours\\nof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn\\non Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And\\nLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\\', if\\nthey should be of use to us.\"\\n\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps she\\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see\\ntoo little of one\\'s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence\\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\n\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place where\\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could\\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another might\\nbe remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\nout even so much as this.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 48\\n\\n\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\\nThey were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to\\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\\ninformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,\\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,\\nto the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\\nsecurity for her husband\\'s not being killed in a duel.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable\\nto her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\\ngreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity,\\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\nthem.\\n\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\\nbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\\'s family.\\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;\\nand everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\\nher sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less\\nof it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come\\nwhen, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely\\ndespaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of\\nthem.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a\\nletter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately\\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;\\nthat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,\\nbut without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\\ndid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.\\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised\\nto write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:\\n\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the regiment,\\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\\nknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were\\nanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a\\nclue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any\\nother person.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her\\nauthority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information\\nof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never\\nheard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both\\nof whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;\\nand though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application\\nwas a something to look forward to.\\n\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters\\nwas the grand object of every morning\\'s impatience. Through letters,\\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every\\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\n\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\\n\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\nin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from\\nHertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\\nsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in\\nyour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\\nproceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be\\nwanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that\\nmay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\\nmost afflicting to a parent\\'s mind. The death of your daughter would\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\\nbe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\\ninforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\\nproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\\nfor the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\\nthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be\\nguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,\\nyou are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined\\nby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to\\nwhom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\\nthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\\nall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,\\nwill connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads\\nme moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\\nof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to\\nconsole yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\\nfrom your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her\\nown heinous offense.\\n\\n\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from\\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he\\nkept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one\\nliving. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he\\nhad been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of\\nparticular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,\\nwho could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the\\nwretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for\\nsecrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\\'s relations, for\\nit had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\\nvery considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a\\nthousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\\nHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\nformidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars\\nfrom the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \"A gamester!\"\\nshe cried. \"This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their\\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\\nspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded\\nto his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return to his family, and\\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried. \"Sure he\\nwill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?\"\\n\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\\nand the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet\\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\\nDerbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His\\nname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and\\nthe kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their\\nbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had\\nreceived none since her return that could come from Pemberley.\\n\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\\nfairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time\\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\\nLydia\\'s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\\none sleepless night out of two.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\nphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\\naway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\\nit.\\n\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that\\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \"Say\\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\\nand I ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone\\nto fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\\nIt will pass away soon enough.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\n\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\n\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence there\\nwill probably be of some duration.\"\\n\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\n\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me\\nlast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\\'s\\ntea.\\n\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such an\\nelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\\nI can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\"\\n\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully. \"If I should\\never go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne\\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and\\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into\\nmy house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be\\nabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.\\nAnd you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have\\nspent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\"\\n\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 49\\n\\n\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\\ncoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their\\nmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,\\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon,\\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\"\\n\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t you know\\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\\nthis half-hour, and master has had a letter.\"\\n\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\\nlibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\\nseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the\\nbutler, who said:\\n\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking towards the\\nlittle copse.\"\\n\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once\\nmore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\\npursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\n\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as\\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\n\\n\"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\"\\n\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the letter from\\nhis pocket. \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\n\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what it is\\nabout.\"\\n\\n\"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,\\n\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,\\nupon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you\\nleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of\\nLondon they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough\\nto know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\"\\n\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\n\\nElizabeth read on:\\n\\n\"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there\\nwas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the\\nengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will\\nnot be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure\\nto your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand\\npounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and\\nmy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,\\nduring your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,\\nas far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\\nexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\\nwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham\\'s\\ncircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.\\nThe world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there\\nwill be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to\\nsettle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude\\nwill be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout\\nthe whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to\\nHaggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the\\nsmallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at\\nLongbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as\\nfast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it\\nbest that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\nyou will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\\nanything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,\\n\\n\"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \"Can it be\\npossible that he will marry her?\"\\n\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said her\\nsister. \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\n\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\n\\nMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\\nwrote.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write immediately.\\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.\"\\n\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose, must be\\ncomplied with.\"\\n\\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\n\\n\"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\\nare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money\\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever\\nto pay him.\"\\n\\n\"Money! My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a\\ntemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\\ngone.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred to me\\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!\\nit must be my uncle\\'s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\\nless than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\\nin the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\n\\n\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\nrepaid?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued\\nsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the\\nlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\\nwere by themselves. \"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be\\nthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\"\\n\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly would\\nnot marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\\nuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\\nthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\\nof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\\npounds?\"\\n\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\" said\\nElizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\\nnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never\\nbe requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\nfirst sees my aunt!\"\\n\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\" said\\nJane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to\\nmarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\\n\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither you, nor\\nI, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\"\\n\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\\nit known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly\\nreplied:\\n\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\n\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\n\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\n\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs\\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s being soon\\nmarried, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she\\nhad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried. \"This is delightful indeed! She will\\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!\\nMy good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage\\neverything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him\\nhow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\n\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\\nGardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\n\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great\\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but\\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\\never had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!\\nIn a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and\\nyou write for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\n\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day\\'s delay, she observed,\\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\n\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call\\non Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.\\nAn airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you\\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\n\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was\\nno worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could\\nbe justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had\\nfeared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had\\ngained.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 50\\n\\n\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,\\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for\\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever\\nof honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\\nher husband might then have rested in its proper place.\\n\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he\\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\\nuseless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join\\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\\nBennet, for many years after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he\\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then\\ntoo late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\nincome.\\n\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\\nregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,\\nthough expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would\\nbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the\\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\\nthrough her mother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\nthat sum.\\n\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\\nanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as\\nlittle trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\\ndispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\\nin its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\\nwas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any\\nmessage to her.\\n\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate\\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage\\nof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant\\nfarmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from\\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit\\nin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\\nwas considered certain.\\n\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this\\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object\\nof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\\nproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\nimportance.\\n\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--or the\\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\\ntoo far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\\nPulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\n\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \"Mrs.\\nBennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and\\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\\nimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It\\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\\nclothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than to any sense of\\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\\ntook place.\\n\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\\nproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\\nspot.\\n\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were\\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\\nbut, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\\'s\\nfrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\\nof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\\nthere seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other\\nobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the\\nnearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.\\n\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The\\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\\nshould meet.\\n\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\\nhave been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,\\nthere must be a triumph.\\n\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\\nand from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she\\nmust have received benefit of greater importance.\\n\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\\nfamily.\\n\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\\nshe could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\\nbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\\nwere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to\\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\\npurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved\\non quitting the militia.\\n\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as soon as\\nhis marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\\nconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on\\nhis account and my niece\\'s. It is Mr. Wickham\\'s intention to go into\\nthe regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who\\nare able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\\nensigncy in General ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It\\nis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\\nin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I\\nhave pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\\na list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,\\nand all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\nGardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\\nleaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.,\\n\\n\"E. GARDINER.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\\'s removal\\nfrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet\\nwas not so well pleased with it. Lydia\\'s being settled in the North,\\njust when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,\\nfor she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.\\n\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite shocking\\nto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----\\'s\\nregiment.\"\\n\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\\nurged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show\\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\nNorth. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent\\nhis permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as\\nthe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was\\nsurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and\\nhad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would\\nhave been the last object of her wishes.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 51\\n\\n\\nTheir sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\\nprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to\\nmeet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their\\narrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,\\nwho gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she\\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\\nmust endure.\\n\\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive\\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to\\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\\nanxious, uneasy.\\n\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,\\nto Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an\\nalacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\\n\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\\nenough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\\nwas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,\\nand fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\\ncongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\\nround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\\nobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\\nthere.\\n\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\\nwere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\\nnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\\nresolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence\\nof an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the\\ntwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\\n\\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\\nwith a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her\\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\\nthe world.\\n\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away;\\nit seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\\n\\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the\\npeople hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;\\nand we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he\\nshould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took\\noff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that\\nhe might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\\nthe dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother\\'s right hand, and hear her say\\nto her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\\nlower, because I am a married woman.\"\\n\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and\\nall their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\"\\nby each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her\\nring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast\\nroom, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I\\nam sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half\\nmy good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\\nhusbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\n\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\\'t\\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\\nthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\\nshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\\nballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\\n\\n\"I should like it beyond anything!\" said her mother.\\n\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\\nwinter is over.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I do not\\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\n\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\\nthink, than such as did not.\\n\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected\\nto find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him. She had scarcely needed her\\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\\nof having a companion.\\n\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\\nthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\\nthe first of September, than any body else in the country.\\n\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You\\nwere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you\\ncurious to hear how it was managed?\"\\n\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said\\non the subject.\"\\n\\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s lodgings were in\\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\\no\\'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\\nwere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\\nsuch a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\\nput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\\nmy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\\nif she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\\nten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\\nto know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\\'ll believe\\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\\nbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\\nthey get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\\ndid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\\nwere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\\ncame back again in ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out. However,\\nI recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\\nme! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\\n\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the\\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will\\nask you no questions.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you\\nall, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\n\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\\npower, by running away.\\n\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\\nit was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\\nher sister\\'s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\nintended.\\n\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be\\nto know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\\nspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems\\nto think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\\nignorance.\"\\n\\n\"Not that I _shall_, though,\" she added to herself, as she finished\\nthe letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\\nout.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad\\nof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 52\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it\\nthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to\\nbe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to\\nbe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\\ncontain a denial.\\n\\n\"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,\\n\\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning\\nto answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise\\nwhat I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your\\napplication; I did not expect it from _you_. Don\\'t think me angry,\\nhowever, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such\\ninquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to\\nunderstand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised\\nas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really\\ninnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.\\n\\n\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most\\nunexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several\\nhours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\\ndreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\\nGardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\\nand that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\\nLydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\\nafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\nthem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\\nhimself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so well known as to\\nmake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\\nin him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\\nconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\\nactions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\\ncalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\\nan evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\\nmotive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\\nin town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\\ndirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\\nof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\\n\\n\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\\ngoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\\nof disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\\nhouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\nlodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\\nWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\\ntown. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\\nwanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\\ncorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\\nWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\\nshe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\\ntheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\\nwished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\\nafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\\nacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\\nsituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\\non to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\\nhe found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\\nfor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\\nof leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\\nother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\\nit only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\\nin his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\\nbeen _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\\non account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\\nscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\\'s flight on her\\nown folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\\nto his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\\nmust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\\nnothing to live on.\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though\\nMr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\\nto do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\\nmarriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\\ncherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\\nsome other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\\nto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\n\\n\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\\ncourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be\\nreasonable.\\n\\n\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to\\nmake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\\nstreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\\nstill with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\\nyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\\nuncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\\ndeparture of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\\nday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\n\\n\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\\nand, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\\n\\n\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all\\nsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\nLongbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\\nobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\\naccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\\nNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\\nI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\\nuncle would most readily have settled the whole.\\n\\n\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\\nthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\\nwas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\\nniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\\nwhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\\nthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\\nthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\\nit was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\\nat most.\\n\\n\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\\npeople. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\\nmore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\\nsettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\\nthis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\\nwas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\\nhad been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\\nin _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody\\'s_ reserve,\\ncan be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\\nmy dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\\nnever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\\ninterest_ in the affair.\\n\\n\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\\nwere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in\\nLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were\\nthen to receive the last finish.\\n\\n\"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which\\nyou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\\nafford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\\nadmission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\\nknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not\\nperceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming\\nhome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\\nyou can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most\\nserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\\ndone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\\nsometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and\\nJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\\nattended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\\ntown again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my\\ndear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\\nenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\\nin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little\\nmore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach\\nhim. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\\nslyness seems the fashion.\\n\\n\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy\\ntill I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\\npair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\n\\n\"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half\\nhour.\\n\\n\"Yours, very sincerely,\\n\\n\"M. GARDINER.\"\\n\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\\nproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s\\nmatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\\npain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\\nHe had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all\\nthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\\nsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\\ndespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason\\nwith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\\navoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had\\ndone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her\\nheart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\\nchecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity\\nwas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for\\na woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so\\nnatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law\\nof Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,\\nto be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had\\ngiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary\\nstretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\\nwrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\\nthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\\ncould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\\nhis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\\nconcerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\\nunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They\\nowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!\\nhow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\\nencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\\nof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\\nShe read over her aunt\\'s commendation of him again and again. It\\nwas hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some\\npleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\\nand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted\\nbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\\'s\\napproach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\\novertaken by Wickham.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\" said he,\\nas he joined her.\\n\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not follow\\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and\\nnow we are better.\"\\n\\n\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\n\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\n\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\n\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\\nmisrepresented.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\\n\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\nElizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him there at this\\ntime of year.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\n\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\n\\n\"Very much.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\n\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\n\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\\nmost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\\nme in every respect.\"\\n\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\n\\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,\\nand the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\\nrepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\\nquiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\\nof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\\ncircumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\\n\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\\n\\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\\nfirst, you may remember.\"\\n\\n\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not\\nso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\\nhad been compromised accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\\n\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\\nto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister\\'s sake, to provoke him,\\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\\n\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let\\nus quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\\nmind.\"\\n\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 53\\n\\n\\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he\\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\\nhad said enough to keep him quiet.\\n\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was\\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! I don\\'t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\\ndo.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\\'s. He\\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\\nthe house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\\nus all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\\n\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with\\none\\'s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\"\\n\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\" said\\nElizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\\nsingle.\"\\n\\n\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\\nbut only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be so far off. If\\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\\n\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\n\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs.\\nPhillips first brought her the news). \"Well, so much the better. Not\\nthat I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am\\nsure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome\\nto come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\\nBut that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\\nmention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\\n\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in\\nMeryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\\ncomes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\\ngoing to the butcher\\'s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\\n\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\\'t imagine it was from\\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\\n_myself_, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\n\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\\nthere _with_ his friend\\'s permission, or being bold enough to come\\nwithout it.\\n\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot\\ncome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this\\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\"\\n\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\\nfeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you\\nwill wait on him of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\\'s errand again.\"\\n\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\\nNetherfield.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society,\\nlet him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours\\nin running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\\non him. But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\\nhim.\"\\n\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\nhusband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\\n\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\\nsays. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it\\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\\nalways so much.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\\nand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\\nthe days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\\nhopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\\narrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\n\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\\nto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\\nagain by her sister.\\n\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\\n\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with\\nhim before. Mr. what\\'s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\\nMr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\n\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\\nmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being heard by either\\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\\nTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\\nand whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\\nwishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\\n\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\\nenough for expectation.\"\\n\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\\nher sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\\ngentlemen\\'s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\\nsymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s\\npresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\\nnot an improbable, conjecture.\\n\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\\nher curtsey and address to his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\\nthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\\nwas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\\napplied.\\n\\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\\nwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\\nwas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\\nwith herself for being so.\\n\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\\n\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\\n\\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\\nseen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, \\'Lately,\\nGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\' without there being a\\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\\nIt was my brother Gardiner\\'s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\\n\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\\nnot tell.\\n\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\\ncontinued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\\nhard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\\nNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\\nI do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\\nheard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\\nregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\\nmisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\\ndone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\\nthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\\n\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\\nBennet\\'s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\\nwill save all the best of the covies for you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\\nflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\\nmoments of such painful confusion.\\n\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to\\nbe in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\\none or the other again!\"\\n\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\\nhow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\\nformer lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\\nbut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\\nfound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\\nas unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\\nthat she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\\nLongbourn in a few days time.\\n\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when\\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\\nus, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\\nyou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\\nyour engagement.\"\\n\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\\nof one who had ten thousand a year.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 54\\n\\n\\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\\nor in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that\\nmust deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\\'s behaviour astonished and vexed her.\\n\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\" said she,\\n\"did he come at all?\"\\n\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when\\nhe was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If\\nhe no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will\\nthink no more about him.\"\\n\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her\\nbetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\\nseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent\\nacquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly. \"Oh, Jane,\\ntake care.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\"\\n\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\\nyou as ever.\"\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\\nhumour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had\\nrevived.\\n\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality\\nas sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\\nthe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\\nto invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\\n\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\\nHe bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\\nalarm.\\n\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an\\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\\nElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\\'s happiness, and his\\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\\'s mind;\\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\\nhim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\\nfamily.\\n\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than\\nthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious\\nand uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\\ngentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her\\nuncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\\n\"If he does not come to me, _then_,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for\\never.\"\\n\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\\nin so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of\\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:\\n\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\\ndo we?\"\\n\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\\nto help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for\\nbeing so silly!\\n\\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\\n\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\\n\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,\\nthese three weeks.\"\\n\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\\'s whispering\\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies\\nall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,\\nwhen all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her\\nmother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\nsupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What\\nsay you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\\nI assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so\\nfat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\\nLucases\\' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\\nwhat do you think she said besides? \\'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\\nat Netherfield at last.\\' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\\na creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\\nand not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\\nBingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The\\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\\nmay often meet again.\"\\n\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.\\nI assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\\npleasing, than any other man.\"\\n\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and\\nare provoking me to it every moment.\"\\n\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\n\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\n\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\nacknowledge?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 55\\n\\n\\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\\nten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\\n\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would\\ngive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\\n\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\n\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\\naccepted with alacrity.\\n\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them\\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in her dressing\\ngown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\\nLizzy\\'s hair.\"\\n\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is\\nforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\\nWhere is your sash, my dear?\"\\n\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\\nwithout one of her sisters.\\n\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\\ncustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of\\nthe five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\\nKitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do\\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still\\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here, my love, I want to\\nspeak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look\\nat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\\nentreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.\\nBennet half-opened the door and called out:\\n\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother, as\\nsoon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in\\nmy dressing-room.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\nquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\\ninto the drawing-room.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\\nthing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\\nease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\\nevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\\nmother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\\nof countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\\n\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\\naway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\\nthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\nconcurrence.\\n\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent\\nthe morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get\\nevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\\nto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\\nfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\\nwanted to counteract her mother\\'s schemes.\\n\\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\\nsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\\nhad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\\nsister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\\nboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\\nhave told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she\\nthought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\\nElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\\nwell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\\npleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\\nwhy is not everybody as happy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\\na delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\\nsaid for the present.\\n\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\\n\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\\ncard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\n\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\\n\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\ncircumspection! of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance! the\\nhappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\n\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\\nfather had been short and to the purpose.\\n\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\\n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\"\\n\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed\\nher delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\\nbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\nhimself.\\n\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\\nMiss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or\\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when\\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\\nhow really happy he was.\\n\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\\nturned to his daughter, and said:\\n\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\\n\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\ngoodness.\\n\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\\nalways exceed your income.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\\nunpardonable in me.\"\\n\\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\\nmore.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\\nhappy! I am sure I shan\\'t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\\nthat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\\never was seen!\"\\n\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\\nfavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\\n\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\\nobliged to accept.\\n\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\\nwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\\nbut she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\\nof separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\\nalways attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\\nher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\\nrelief.\\n\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me that he\\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\\nit possible.\"\\n\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing. They were certainly no friends to\\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\\ncan never be what we once were to each other.\"\\n\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\n\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\\nhe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\\nindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\"\\n\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\\nmodesty.\"\\n\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased\\nto find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\\nthough Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\\nknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\\nJane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\\nabove them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but\\nsuch another man for you!\"\\n\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\\nyou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\n\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,\\nand she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\\nneighbours in Meryton.\\n\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\\nworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 56\\n\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with Jane had been\\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\\nthe lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\\nshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\\nopen and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\\nother reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight inclination of the\\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\\nname to her mother on her ladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of\\nintroduction had been made.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\\nfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\nmother.\"\\n\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\\n\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.\\n\"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\\nand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man\\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\"\\n\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\\nsummer; the windows are full west.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then\\nadded:\\n\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\\nMrs. Collins well.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\\n\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\\nrefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\\nwill favour me with your company.\"\\n\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her ladyship about the\\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\\nhall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\\nlooking rooms, walked on.\\n\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\\nher face.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\\nmanner:--\\n\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\\ncome.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\\nfor the honour of seeing you here.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\\nknow, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\\nyou, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\\nafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\\non setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\\nwith astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\\nso far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\\n\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\\n\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth\\ncoolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\\nis in existence.\"\\n\\n\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\\nreport is spread abroad?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\n\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\\nask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\"\\n\\n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\\n\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\\nreason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\\nmay have drawn him in.\"\\n\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\\n\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\\never induce me to be explicit.\"\\n\\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\\nengaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\\nmake an offer to me.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\\nthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\\nbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\\nthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\\nhours he was destined for his cousin?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\\nno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\\nbe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\\nmarry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\\nby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\n\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\\nMiss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\\nby any of us.\"\\n\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr.\\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\\nto repine.\"\\n\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\\nI be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s\\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more pitiable;\\nbut it will have no effect on me.\"\\n\\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father\\'s, from respectable,\\nhonourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\\nThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\\nor fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\\nwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\\nwhich you have been brought up.\"\\n\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s daughter; so far we are\\nequal.\"\\n\\n\"True. You _are_ a gentleman\\'s daughter. But who was your mother?\\nWho are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\\ncondition.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does\\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\n\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\\nmoment\\'s deliberation:\\n\\n\"I am not.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\\n\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\\nI will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\\nassurance I require.\"\\n\\n\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\\nmarriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\\nmy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\nAllow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\\nsupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\\napplication was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\\nyou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\\nnephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\\nbut you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\\ntherefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\nobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\\nno stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\\'s infamous\\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man\\'s marrying her was a\\npatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\\nsuch a girl to be my nephew\\'s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\\nlate father\\'s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\\nyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\n\\n\"You can now have nothing further to say,\" she resentfully answered.\\n\"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to\\nthe house.\"\\n\\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\\nback. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\"\\n\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\n\\n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\\n\\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\\n\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any\\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s\\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\\nthe scorn.\"\\n\\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.\\nI shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\\nreasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\"\\n\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \"I take no leave\\nof you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve\\nno such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\nladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother\\nimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were\\nwell. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through\\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 57\\n\\n\\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\nElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many\\nhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report\\nof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours\\nat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had\\nonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked\\nforward to as possible at some future time.\\n\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could not help\\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\\nan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\nwas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often\\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\\nfriend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to understand\\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\\nat all.\"\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\\nbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and\\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\\n\\nThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\\n\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to\\ntell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\\nconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it\\nmight be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\\nconsequent explanations.\\n\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He\\nthen said,\\n\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\\ncontents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink\\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\"\\n\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the instantaneous\\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\\nherself; when her father continued:\\n\\n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\\n\\n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\"\\n\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\\non that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: \\'Having thus\\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;\\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\\nher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may\\nbe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in\\nthis land.\\'\\n\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \\'This young\\ngentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\\nmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\\npatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\\nElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate\\nclosure with this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\\'\\n\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:\\n\\n\"\\'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine\\nthat his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\\na friendly eye.\\'\\n\\n\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within\\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie\\nmore effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his\\nlife! It is admirable!\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could only force\\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\\nlittle agreeable to her.\\n\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\\n\\n\"\\'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\\' Mr.\\nCollins moreover adds, \\'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\\'s sad\\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\\nfrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,\\nas a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.\\' That is his notion of Christian\\nforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s\\nsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\\nlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\\nlive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\\nturn?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so\\nstrange!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\\npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any\\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\\n\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by\\nhis repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she\\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but\\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 58\\n\\n\\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\\'s\\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time\\nto tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat\\nin momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five\\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others\\nto outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\\nwas too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\\ndesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\n\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon\\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\\nmoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was\\nhigh, she immediately said:\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\\nrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my\\npoor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\\nof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\\nand emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\\nwas so little to be trusted.\"\\n\\n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\\nsake of discovering them.\"\\n\\n\"If you _will_ thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\\nonly of _you_.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\\nher companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\\naffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence\\nme on this subject for ever.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\\nso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\\nhappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\\nbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\\nexpression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\\nbut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\n\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\\nto the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through\\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\\nevery expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\\'s apprehension,\\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that\\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise\\nfrom her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\\nladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,\\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough\\nof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\\nyour relations.\"\\n\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\\nbehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\\n\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\\nevening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\\nwill be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved\\nin civility.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \\'had you behaved in a\\nmore gentlemanlike manner.\\' Those were your words. You know not, you can\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,\\nI confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\\n\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\\na way.\"\\n\\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\\nway that would induce you to accept me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\\n\\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon make you\\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\\ncontents?\"\\n\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her\\nformer prejudices had been removed.\\n\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\\nespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\\npower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\\njustly make you hate me.\"\\n\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\\nchanged as that implies.\"\\n\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\\ncalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\n\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\\nso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\\ncircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\\nof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\\npleasure.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your\\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\\ninnocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\\nwhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\\nbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\\nwas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\\nwas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\nUnfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt\\nby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all\\nthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught\\nme to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family\\ncircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least\\nto think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I\\nwas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been\\nbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\\ntaught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,\\nI was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.\\nYou showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman\\nworthy of being pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\\nwishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\n\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\"\\n\\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\\na proper direction.\"\\n\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at\\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\n\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\\n\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to show you, by every civility in\\nmy power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to\\nobtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\\nintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\\nhour after I had seen you.\"\\n\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness\\nthere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\\ncomprehend.\\n\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\\neach, to be dwelt on farther.\\n\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\\nit was time to be at home.\\n\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder which\\nintroduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with\\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\\nit.\\n\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\" And\\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\\nthe case.\\n\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I\\ntold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\\nthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\\nfriend.\\n\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when you told him\\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\"\\n\\n\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\\nwhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\\n\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\\nhis reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\\none thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\\nin any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\\nnow.\"\\n\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,\\nand it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness\\nof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\\nparted.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 59\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a question\\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,\\nand from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to\\nsay in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt\\nin the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no\\none liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\\ndislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\\nfrom Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\\nyou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\\nI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\\nin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\\nengaged.\"\\n\\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\\nyou dislike him.\"\\n\\n\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\\ndid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as\\nthese, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\\nremember it myself.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\nseriously assured her of its truth.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried\\nJane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\\ncertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\\nhappy with him?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\\nJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\\n\\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\\nto do?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\\ntell you all.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\\nafraid you will be angry.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let\\nme know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me\\nhow long you have loved him?\"\\n\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\\nBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\\nat Pemberley.\"\\n\\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances\\nof attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\\nfurther to wish.\\n\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself.\\nI always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,\\nI must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\\'s friend and your\\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But\\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\\nof it to another, not to you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling\\nto mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\\nher equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer\\nconceal from her his share in Lydia\\'s marriage. All was acknowledged,\\nand half the night spent in conversation.\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\\nmorning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\\ncoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s\\nway.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\\nepithet.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk\\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\\nnever seen the view.\"\\n\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am\\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\\'t it, Kitty?\" Kitty owned that\\nshe had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see\\nthe view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went\\nup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\\n\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\ndisagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is\\nall for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking\\nto him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to\\ninconvenience.\"\\n\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent should be\\nasked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the\\napplication for her mother\\'s. She could not determine how her mother\\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit\\nto her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear\\nthe first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\ndisapprobation.\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\\nextreme. She did not fear her father\\'s opposition, but he was going to\\nbe made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,\\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\npretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he\\nwants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\\n\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\\n\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\\nBut will they make you happy?\"\\n\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my\\nindifference?\"\\n\\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\n\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\\nsuch terms.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know\\nyour disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\\nabout.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and\\nat length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object\\nof her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of\\nhim had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection\\nwas not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months\\'\\nsuspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did\\nconquer her father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to\\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\"\\n\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;\\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\\'s debts, and got him\\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\\nand economy. Had it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and _would_ have\\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\\n\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\\nMr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\\nat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come\\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\\nhalf an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\\nthe others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for\\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\\nwould come in time.\\n\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\\nfor on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could\\ncomprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit\\nwhat was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\\nhave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\\nyou will have! Jane\\'s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my\\ndear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I\\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing\\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\\nLord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\\n\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and\\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\\nher mother followed her.\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten\\nthousand a year, and very likely more! \\'Tis as good as a Lord! And a\\nspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But\\nmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,\\nthat I may have it to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the gentleman\\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\\'\\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to\\nhim, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her\\ndeference for his opinion.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\\nevery hour in his esteem.\\n\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he. \"Wickham, perhaps,\\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\\nas Jane\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 60\\n\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \"How could\\nyou begin?\" said she. \"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\\nyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\\nplace?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\\nlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\\nknew that I _had_ begun.\"\\n\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;\\ndid you admire me for my impertinence?\"\\n\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\n\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and\\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you\\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\\nin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\\nit; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\\nreasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\\nof _that_ when they fall in love.\"\\n\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was\\nill at Netherfield?\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\\nby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\\nbe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling\\nto come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\\nyou look as if you did not care about me?\"\\n\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\"\\n\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\n\\n\"And so was I.\"\\n\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\n\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\\nyou _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of\\nthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.\\n_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\\nsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the\\nsubject. This will never do.\"\\n\\n\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\\nCatherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour\\nto wait for any opening of yours. My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me\\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\\nor had you intended any more serious consequence?\"\\n\\n\"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\\nmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\\nmyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,\\nand if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\"\\n\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\\nbefall her?\"\\n\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it\\nought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be\\ndone directly.\"\\n\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and\\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\"\\n\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\\nhad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s\\nlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would\\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and\\naunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\\nfor your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the\\ntruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your\\nfancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the\\nsubject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you\\ncannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,\\nfor not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your\\nidea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I\\nam the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\\nbefore, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\\nonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\\nhe can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\nYours, etc.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still\\ndifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply\\nto his last.\\n\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\\n\"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon\\nbe the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.\\nBut, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\\n\\n\"Yours sincerely, etc.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even\\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\\nformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was\\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\n\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,\\nwas as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\\nbeing loved by her sister.\\n\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered\\nso exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that\\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of\\nher husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\\nmeeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent composure. If he did\\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his\\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in\\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\\'s good\\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\\nNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\\nlikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield\\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep\\nhim to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing\\nto either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\\nPemberley.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 61\\n\\n\\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride\\nshe afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may\\nbe guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many\\nof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity\\nin so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\\ninvariably silly.\\n\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\\nsisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\\nto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\\ntemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\\'s example,\\nshe became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia\\'s\\nsociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\\'s being quite\\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her own,\\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\\nmuch reluctance.\\n\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\\nthing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\\nto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\\nfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\\nif not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\\neffect:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\n\\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\\nWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so\\nrich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.\\nI am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not\\nthink we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.\\nAny place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,\\ndo not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n\\n\"Yours, etc.\"\\n\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in\\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\\nof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\\ntowards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\\nsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for\\nher soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and\\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\\nreputation which her marriage had given her.\\n\\nThough Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was\\noccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\\nin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\\nstaid so long, that even Bingley\\'s good humour was overcome, and he\\nproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\\n\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but as she\\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\\ndropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\\nto Elizabeth.\\n\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the sisters\\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\\nother even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with\\nan astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of\\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen\\nin her way. By Elizabeth\\'s instructions, she began to comprehend that\\na woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not\\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\n\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in\\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion,\\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\\non them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\nDarcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\\nher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Belgium, a peaceful modern nation,\\nhas been swept by fire and sword, and its honest, pious inhabitants\\ntortured and massacred, not because the German soldiery desired to wreak\\nsuch vengeance upon a people with whom they could have no quarrel, but\\nbecause they had been encouraged \\u201cto act with unrelenting severity, to\\ncreate examples which by their frightfulness would be a warning to the\\nwhole country.\\u201d\\n\\nThe wild orgies of blood and debauchery, the atrocious outrages,\\nmurders, and mutilations, the ruthless violation and killing of\\ndefenceless women, girls, and children of tender age, have been, it is\\nnow admitted by the Germans themselves, carried out with their full\\nknowledge, and even as part of the actual plan of campaign of their\\nWar-Lords.\\n\\nGermany, though boasting of her culture, her refinement, her honest\\nhome-life, and the peaceful efforts of her Emperor, has for ever lost\\nher place among civilized nations. It now stands revealed that when her\\ndiplomatic methods of base chicanery and lying fail then she does not\\nhesitate to resort to acts so dastardly and inhuman as to have no\\nparallel. Not only has she broken her most solemn treaties and moral\\nengagements, but all the rules of civilized warfare to which she was a\\nsignatory at The Hague she has also violated, merely regarding them as\\n\\u201ca scrap of paper.\\u201d\\n\\nNot content with resorting to every act of savagery and every refinement\\nof cruelty which degenerated minds, filled with the blood-lust of war,\\ncould conceive, her troops, by order of her generals, have made a\\npractice all along the line of placing before them innocent women and\\nchildren to act as a living screen, in the hope that the Allies would\\nnot, from motives of humanity, fire upon them.\\n\\nOne cannot read a single page of this awful record--the German Black\\nBook--without being thrilled with horror at unspeakable acts of\\ncivilized troops, who, at the behest of their Kaiser, and the exposed\\nyet still ruling _camarilla_ at Berlin, have become simply as the Huns\\nof Attila.\\n\\nThe contents of this book are no hearsay stories, but hard facts\\nofficially recorded in _dossiers_ in the French and Belgian Ministries\\nof War, most of them, indeed, sworn statements taken before\\nburgomasters, mayors, prefects, and magistrates. Even our brave fellows\\nwounded in the Kaiser\\u2019s savage attack upon Europe have brought back from\\nthe front similar narratives of the most appalling crimes. Evidence of\\nGerman trickery and savagery we have, too, in our midst, for trains,\\nsentries, and policemen have been shot at under cover of darkness by men\\nwho mean to emulate the methods of their compatriots.\\n\\nThe frightful deeds which have been done over the face of Belgium and in\\nFrance are, no doubt, intended to be repeated in Great Britain, and, if\\nit were possible, the Red Hand of Destruction would certainly be laid\\nvery heavy upon us--more heavily, perhaps, because we, by our honesty of\\npurpose, have incurred the hatred of Kaiserdom.\\n\\nI would bid all sufferers in Belgium and France to remember that when\\nAttila of old came to Chalons, full of ostentation as the great\\nWar-Lord, he came to his own undoing, and his dominion at once\\ndisappeared to the winds. There is One with Whom vengeance lies for\\nwrongs, and most assuredly will He mete out the same dread Fate of death\\nand obscurity to the unblushing War-Lord of Germany, who, daily, with\\nhis blasphemous impiety, lifts his bloodstained hands and thanks his\\nMaker for his shameful \\u201csuccesses.\\u201d\\n\\nWILLIAM LE QUEUX.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n\\n                                                                    PAGE\\n\\nPREFACE                                                                5\\n\\nWHAT THE KAISER SAID                                                   8\\n\\nFOREWORD                                                               9\\n\\nAUTHOR\\u2019S NOTE                                                         10\\n\\nINTRODUCTION                                                          11\\n\\nCHAPTER I.

It is worth while to recall the\\nmethods of this savage, for he was nothing better. In one expedition\\nacross Greece and in another across Italy he reduced seventy of the\\nfinest cities to smoking ruins and to shambles. The inhabitants were\\neither slaughtered on the spot or marched away in chains to end their\\nlives as slaves. Men, women, children, babies--all came alike to this\\nblack demon of outrage and destruction. Briefly, the Monarch of the Huns\\nmay be best described as the worthy leader of one vast gang of\\nJack-the-Rippers.\\n\\nAnd this is the blood-guilty ruffian whom the Kaiser now holds up as his\\nexemplar! Judging by Louvain, he is no unworthy follower of his Master.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_AUTHOR\\u2019S NOTE_\\n\\n\\n_In addition to the sworn facts and statements supplied officially to me\\nby the Belgian Government, I have here included some others which have\\nbeen recounted by wounded men who have returned from the front, by\\ndoctors who have attended them, and by the special correspondents of\\nReuter\\u2019s, the Central News, and other news agencies, and of the London\\nand provincial newspapers._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGERMAN ATROCITIES.\\n\\n\\nMr. Asquith has described the sacking of Louvain as \\u201cthe greatest crime\\ncommitted against civilization and culture since the Thirty Years\\u2019 War.\\nWith its buildings, its pictures, its unique library, its unrivalled\\nassociations, a shameless holocaust of irreparable treasures lit up by\\nblind barbarian vengeance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_INTRODUCTION._\\n\\n\\nIt was a little over a month after the declaration of war that reports\\nof great events began to crowd in upon us. Much had happened in that\\nshort space of time. The enormous forces of the Kaiser had forced back\\nthe line of the Allies well into France. We admired the huge machine at\\nwork. From a military point of view the rapidity of the advance of such\\nan enormous body of men was something unique in warfare. It was not this\\nwonderful achievement of the German army, however, it was not the\\nequally wonderful resistance made by the Allies against overwhelming\\nnumbers, it was not the glorious record of Belgian, French, and British\\nheroism--which resulted in practically nothing being gained by their\\nadversary--it was none of these things that aroused and amazed the\\nnations of the civilized world. It was something very different which\\narrested their horrified wonder, something which, in the words of the\\n_Times_, \\u201cwill turn the hand of every civilized nation in the world\\nagainst them\\u201d (the German nation).\\n\\nThe atrocious acts committed by the troops of the Kaiser have staggered\\nthe civilized world, and it must now be plain to the meanest\\nintelligence that these atrocities and acts of inhuman barbarity were\\nnot the doings of soldiers intoxicated with the excitement of success in\\nbattle, or maddened to the point of avenging defeat, or to be ascribed\\nto an unbridled license of irresponsible troops out of hand. There is no\\nlonger any doubt, even in minds slow to believe them, that deeds which\\nbring the blush of shame to the cheek as we read of them have been\\nperpetrated; there is as little doubt where the responsibility for them\\nrests. It is with the Kaiser and the men around him.\\n\\n\\nPlain Speaking.\\n\\n\\u201cUntil now we have maintained an attitude of deliberate reserve upon the\\ninnumerable stories of German atrocities which have reached us,\\u201d says\\nthe _Times_. \\u201cWe published without comment the unanswerable list of\\nshocking excesses committed by the German troops, which was sent to\\nEngland by the Belgian authorities. When a German Zeppelin cast bombs\\nupon ill-fated women asleep in their beds at Antwerp, we did no more\\nthan explain the bearings of international law upon conduct which has\\nmet with universal reprobation in Europe and America. But now the real\\nobject of German savagery is self-revealed, not only by the effacement\\nof Louvain, but by the shameful admissions sent forth from the wireless\\nstation at Berlin. On Thursday night the following official notification\\nregarding Belgium came vibrating through the air:--\\n\\n     \\u201c\\u2018The only means of preventing surprise attacks from the civil\\n     population has been to interfere with unrelenting severity and to\\n     create examples which by their frightfulness would be a warning to\\n     the whole country.\\u2019\\n\\n     \\u201cSuch is the cynical nature of the German apologia for the\\n     destruction of Louvain. Such is the character of the warfare of the\\n     modern Huns. They seek to strike terror into the hearts of their\\n     foes by methods which belong to the days of the old barbaric hosts,\\n     who were thought to have vanished from the world for ever.\\n\\n     \\u201cThere must be no mistake about the apportionment of blame for this\\n     and numberless other crimes. We have listened too long to the\\n     bleatings of professors bemused by the false glamour of a\\n     philosophy which the Germans themselves have thrust aside. The\\n     Kaiser and his people are alike responsible for the acts of their\\n     Government and their troops, and there can be no differentiation\\n     when the day of reckoning comes.\\n\\n     \\u201cThe Kaiser could stop these things with a word. Instead, he\\n     pronounces impious benedictions upon them. Daily he appeals for the\\n     blessing of God upon the dreadful deeds which are staining the face\\n     of Western Europe--the ravaged villages, the hapless non-combatants\\n     hanged or shot, the women and children torn from their beds by\\n     cowards and made to walk before them under fire, all the infamies\\n     which have eternally disgraced German \\u2018valour.\\u2019 We are no longer\\n     dependent upon hearsay for these stories. Our own men are bringing\\n     them back from the front. Let there be no mistake as to where the\\n     responsibility rests.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nWhat the Kaiser Said.\\n\\nIt was the Kaiser (addressing his troops in June, 1900, on their setting\\nout for Peking) who said:--\\n\\n     \\u201c_When you meet the foe you will defeat him. No quarter will be\\n     given, no prisoners will be taken. Let all who fall into your hands\\n     be at your mercy. Gain a reputation like the Huns under Attila._\\u201d\\n\\n\\n=And Who Was Attila?=\\n\\n=It is worth while to recall the methods of this savage, for he was\\nnothing better. In one expedition across Greece and in another across\\nItaly he reduced seventy of the finest cities to smoking ruins and to\\nshambles. The inhabitants were either slaughtered on the spot or marched\\naway in chains to end their lives as slaves. Men, women, children,\\nbabies--all came alike to this black demon of outrage and destruction.\\nBriefly, the Monarch of the Huns may be best described as the worthy\\nleader of one vast gang of Jack the Rippers.\\n\\nAnd this is the blood-guilty ruffian whom the Kaiser now holds up as his\\nexemplar! Judging by Louvain, he is no unworthy follower of his Master.=\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThen was it not =Bismarck= who said:--\\n\\n     \\u201c_You must leave the people through whom you march only their eyes\\n     to weep with._\\u201d\\n\\nIt was also the Kaiser who said, addressing his soldiers, \\u201cYou must only\\nhave one will, and it is mine; there is only one law, and it is mine.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd then again, I repeat, it was a Berlin wireless that flashed the\\nofficial message:--\\n\\n     \\u201cThe only means of preventing surprise attacks from the civil\\n     population has been to interfere with unrelenting severity and to\\n     create examples which by their frightfulness would be a warning to\\n     the whole country.\\u201d\\n\\nNeed we seek further to fix the responsibility?\\n\\n\\nWar Rights.\\n\\nWhat are the rights of nations in a state of war? There are first of all\\nthe unwritten laws of nations and humanity which need, or should need,\\nno defining amongst civilized peoples. There are also the definite and\\nspecific Acts laid down at The Hague Convention, which it was declared\\nby the signatories would not be legitimate in war between civilized\\nnations. Germany was a signatory to The Hague Convention. At this\\nConvention the Powers limited the rights of belligerents in the means to\\nbe adopted of injuring the enemy. Here are some of them:--\\n\\n     BY Article XXIII. it was especially forbidden:--\\n\\n     \\u201cTo kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the\\n     hostile nation or army.\\n\\n     \\u201cTo kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down his arms, or\\n     having no longer means of defence, has surrendered at discretion.\\n\\n     \\u201cTo declare that no quarter will be given.\\n\\n     \\u201cTo employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause\\n     unnecessary suffering.\\n\\n     \\u201cTo make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag, or\\n     of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy, as well as the\\n     distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention.\\n\\n     \\u201cTo destroy or seize the enemy\\u2019s property, unless such destruction\\n     or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war.\\u201d\\n\\nThe law of civilized warfare was further made plain as follows:--\\n\\n     Article XXV.: \\u201cThe attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of\\n     towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended, is\\n     prohibited.\\u201d\\n\\n     Article XXVI.: \\u201cThe officer in command of an attacking force must,\\n     before commencing a bombardment, except in cases of assault, do all\\n     in his power to warn the authority.\\u201d\\n\\n     Article XXVII.: \\u201cIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps\\n     must be taken to spare as far as possible buildings dedicated to\\n     religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments,\\n     hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected,\\n     provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.\\n     It is the duty of the besieged to indicate the presence of such\\n     buildings or places by distinctive and visible signs which shall be\\n     notified to the enemy beforehand.\\u201d\\n\\nIn other further Articles it was laid down that a belligerent is\\nforbidden to force the inhabitants of territory occupied by him to\\nfurnish information about the army of the other belligerent, or about\\nits means of defence. It was forbidden to confiscate private property,\\nand also laid down that family honour and rights, the lives of persons,\\nand private property, as well as religious convictions and practice,\\nmust be respected. Pillage was forbidden, and prisoners must be humanely\\ntreated.\\n\\n\\nUncivilized Warfare.\\n\\nStories of German brutality and ruthless disregard of these rules of\\ncivilized warfare as set out above were, from the opening of the war,\\ncontinually reaching England. At first the public were sceptical about\\nsuch tales of horror. Unfortunately, however, it was too clearly seen\\nthat the Germans made war in a manner which was very far from being\\ncivilized. Atrocities were being committed with a definite object--an\\nobject which was self-revealed, not only by the effacement of Louvain,\\n\\u201ca shameless holocaust of irreparable treasures lit up by blind\\nbarbarian vengeance,\\u201d but by the disgraceful admissions sent forth from\\nthe German wireless station which I have already quoted.\\n\\nThe character of the warfare of these modern Huns was to terrorize the\\ninhabitants of a hostile country, so that the invader might proceed on\\nhis way without fear of molestation. Therefore, the unspeakable crimes\\nof the Kaiser\\u2019s forces have not even the excuse of being outbursts of\\nnational savagery. The shameful record contained in these pages are the\\ncold and calculated brutalities of a nation who boasted of its\\n\\u201cculture,\\u201d whose prayerful Emperor held up his hands to his Maker\\ninvoking success for his horde of ruthless barbarians, but who has shown\\nthat in war he respects no law of God, and regards the solemn treaties\\nof nations as \\u201cscraps of paper.\\u201d\\n\\n     \\u201cWe can only pray for a hastening of the day when all that is best\\n     in the German people will reassert itself as of old, and when the\\n     long reign of an arrogant and ruthless military caste will be\\n     looked back to by the countrymen of Schiller and Goethe as a\\n     nightmare that never can return.\\u201d\\n\\n        --From the American _Nation_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\nArticle XXIII. of The Hague Convention forbids:--\\u201cTo kill or wound\\ntreacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nFrom almost the first day of the war this undertaking, given by Germany\\nalong with the other Great Powers, has been treated by her as a \\u201cscrap\\nof paper.\\u201d\\n\\nThe fearful deeds of horror which have besmirched the name of Germany\\nform a terrible page of history. They have been proved by captured\\nGermans themselves to have been deliberate, and to have been actually\\nordered by officers as high in rank as colonels and majors, and to be\\npart of the Kaiser\\u2019s preconceived plan. The murder of unarmed,\\ninoffensive citizens, the hussar-like stroke of sowing neutral waters\\nwith death, the destruction of unfortified towns and the massacre of\\ntheir inhabitants, the violation of women and young girls, the forcing\\nof men, women, and children to march as shields in front of their\\ntroops, the murder of the wounded, the wholesale slaughter of\\nnon-combatants, the tortures, the mutilations, and the vile outrages are\\nsurely sins against humanity, and are bound to meet with an awful and\\njust retribution. The blood of those martyred innocents cries aloud to\\nGod for vengeance, and such vengeance must surely come upon the Kaiser\\nand the inhuman monsters surrounding him who have so deliberately urged\\non their wild assassins to commit the unspeakable crimes reported\\nduring the first month of the war.\\n\\nIt must be remembered, in reading of these terrible atrocities, that\\nwhile they were being committed on the defenceless on every hand, yet\\nthe Kaiser sent a telegram to the King of W\\xfcrtemberg actually thanking\\nthe Almighty for the success of his marauders in their murderous\\ncampaign against women and children. The text of the Kaiser\\u2019s message\\nwas: \\u201cWith God\\u2019s gracious assistance, Duke Albrecht and his splendid\\narmy have gained a glorious victory. You will join me in thanking the\\nAlmighty. I have bestowed on Albrecht the Iron Cross of the First and\\nSecond Class.--WILHELM.\\u201d God\\u2019s gracious assistance!\\n\\nThe ruthless and utterly inexcusable barbarities committed by the German\\narmy were surely without parallel in the whole history of the world. The\\nspectacle of racial degeneration which Germany displayed staggered\\ncivilization, and this awful story of murder, cruelty, and debauchery\\nwill surely remain for all time as a record of infamies which have\\neternally disgraced the German nation. About the apportionment of blame\\nthere must be no mistake. The Kaiser could have prevented it by a single\\nword. But, condemned by his own speech, he and his people are alike\\nresponsible for the acts of the troops, and no differentiation can be\\nmade by right-thinking people.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE BELGIAN COMMISSION. _Photo, Barratt._\\n\\n_Face p. 21._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nMy Interview with Belgian Ministers of State.\\n\\n\\nIn order that the civilized world should be acquainted with the terrible\\natrocities committed in Belgium, the King of the Belgians, who had\\nserved in the trenches with his men, disguised as a private soldier,\\nappointed a Mission to proceed to the President of the United States and\\nlay the case before him. The members of the Mission were:--\\n\\n     =M. Carton de Wiart, Chief of the Mission, who is the Belgian\\n     Minister of Justice;=\\n\\n     =M. de Sadeleer, Leader of the Conservative Party;=\\n\\n     =M. Pau Hemans, Leader of the Liberal Party;=\\n\\n     =M. Emile Van der Velde, Leader of the Socialist Party.=\\n\\n=All these men are Belgian Ministers of State, and were accompanied by\\nCount de Lichtervelde, who acted as Secretary to the Mission.=\\n\\nThe members of this Mission first came to London to present an Address\\nto the King. On the evening of the day these gentlemen were received by\\nHis Majesty, and later by Sir Edward Grey, I had the privilege of a\\nprivate interview with them.\\n\\nI had a long talk with M. Carton de Wiart, during which he unfolded to\\nme many frightful details, and\\n\\n     \\u201c=These abominable crimes against humanity and civilization call for\\n     condign reprobation in the face of the civilized world.... Let us\\n     hear no more whining about German \\u2018culture.\\u2019 But let us make it\\n     known that we will make the world ring with our sense of\\n     horror.=\\u201d--_Frederic Harrison._\\n\\nexplained the reason for the appointment of a committee of inquiry. He\\ndescribed to me scenes he himself had witnessed. He laid stress upon the\\nbombardment and destruction of open towns--that is, towns unprotected\\nand undefended by any military works--such as Malines and Louvain; while\\nAntwerp, being a fortified place, ought to have had twenty-four hours\\u2019\\nnotice given to its inhabitants before it was attacked with bombs, yet\\nno such notice was given. On the contrary, attacks by Zeppelins had been\\nmade without warning in the dead of night. He also described to me the\\natrocities committed by the Germans in the bombardment and setting fire\\nto small villages without any military reason or necessity whatever. He\\nrelated harrowing details of the massacre of perfectly innocent people,\\nnon-combatants, men, women, and children.\\n\\nHe showed me a letter from a person of repute in Belgium who had motored\\nfrom Brussels to Louvain by the Tervueren road, in which I read: \\u201cAfter\\nI got to a village named Veerde St. George I saw only burning villages;\\npeasants beside themselves with terror threw up their arms in sign of\\nsubmission on my approach. When I got to Louvain I found the whole town\\nin ruins, and soldiers were still piling straw against buildings which\\nhad escaped the flames and igniting them.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated Documents.\\n\\nThe mass of documents which the Mission were carrying to America, he\\ninformed me, were all signed statements of persons who had been\\neye-witnesses of the atrocities, as well as those of many who had\\nsuffered.\\n\\nIn a chat I also had with M. Emile Van der Velde, another member of the\\nDelegation and the leader of the Belgian Socialists, he said: \\u201cI went to\\nMalines after the fighting, in order to investigate the state of\\naffairs. I found only eight Belgian people in the town, but even then\\nthe Germans were bombarding the deserted houses, apparently with the\\nsole object of destroying them. The whole object of the Germans,\\u201d he\\nadded, \\u201chad been to create such a reign of terror that the whole\\npopulation of Belgium should flee into Antwerp, and so render it\\nimpossible for the people congregated there to be fed. I myself examined\\nthe bodies of a peasant and his son which had been cut to pieces by\\nbayonet thrusts.\\u201d\\n\\nAnother member of the Delegation told me that he had learned from\\nseveral wounded persons how a druggist living near Tirlemont, on\\nrefusing to act as guide to the Uhlans, was shot three times and then\\nbayoneted; and further, in the same hospital, wounded soldiers had told\\nhim how that while lying upon the battlefield many had been bayoneted or\\nshot.\\n\\nThe Delegation had, earlier in the day on which I had this interview\\nwith them, presented an Address to His Majesty at Buckingham Palace, the\\ntext of which has been published. It ran:--\\n\\n     \\u201cSIRE,--Belgium, having had to choose between the sacrifice of her\\n     honour and the peril of war, did not hesitate. She opposed the\\n     brutal aggression committed by a Power which was one of the\\n     guarantors of her neutrality.\\n\\n     \\u201cIn this critical situation it was for our country an inestimable\\n     tower of strength to see coming forth the resolute and immediate\\n     intervention by great and powerful England.\\n\\n     \\u201cCommissioned by His Majesty the King of the Belgians with a\\n     Mission to the President of the United States, we have considered\\n     it to be our duty to make a stay in the capital of the British\\n     Empire to convey to your Majesty the respectful and ardent\\n     expression of gratitude of the Belgian nation....\\n\\n     \\u201cOur adversary, after invading our territory, has decimated the\\n     civil population, massacred women and children, carried into\\n     captivity inoffensive peasants, put to death wounded, destroyed\\n     undefended towns, burned churches, historical monuments, and the\\n     famous library of the University of Louvain. All these facts are\\n     established by authenticated documents. Each we shall have the\\n     honour of submitting to the Government of your Majesty.\\n\\n     \\u201cIn spite of all this suffering in Belgium, which has been made the\\n     personification of outraged right, the country is resolute in\\n     fulfilling to the utmost her duties towards Europe. Whatever may\\n     happen, she must defend her existence, her honour, and her\\n     liberty.\\u201d\\n\\nThe King, in reply, said that he would support Belgium, and expressed\\nhis horror at the shocking report of German brutality.\\n\\n\\nThe Belgian Minister\\u2019s Statements.\\n\\nThe delegation was subsequently received by Sir Edward Grey at the\\nForeign Office, where they outlined some of the violations of\\ninternational law and of humanity committed by Germany, viz.:--\\n\\n     1. Violation of Belgium\\u2019s neutrality.\\n\\n     2. Taking of several millions of francs from the private National\\n     Bank at Li\\xe9ge and Hasselt.\\n\\n     3. Bombardment of the open towns of Louvain and Malines and the\\n     bombardment of Antwerp at night by airship without the twenty-four\\n     hours\\u2019 notice due in international law to the inhabitants of a\\n     fortified town.\\n\\n     4. Bombardment and burning of villages and the massacre of\\n     non-combatant inhabitants, including women and children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nOur own Press Bureau issued on the 25th August the following statement\\nto the English Press:--\\n\\n\\n\\u201cThe Belgian Minister has made the following statement:--\\n\\n\\u201cIn spite of solemn assurances of good will and long-standing treaty\\nobligations, Germany has made a sudden savage and utterly unwarranted\\nattack on Belgium.\\n\\n\\u201cHowever sorely pressed she may be, Belgium will never fight unfairly\\nand never stoop to infringe the laws and customs of legitimate warfare.\\nShe is putting up a brave fight against overwhelming odds; she may be\\nbeaten, she may be crushed, but, to quote our noble King\\u2019s words, \\u2018She\\nwill never be enslaved.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cWhen German troops invaded our country, the Belgian Government issued\\npublic statements, which were placarded in every town, village, and\\nhamlet, warning all civilians to abstain scrupulously from hostile acts\\nagainst the enemy\\u2019s troops. The Belgian Press daily published similar\\nnotices broadcast through the land. Nevertheless, the German authorities\\nhave issued lately statements containing grave imputations against the\\nattitude of the Belgian civilian population, threatening us at the same\\ntime with dire reprisals. These imputations are contrary to the real\\nfacts of the case, and as to threats of further vengeance, no menace of\\nodious reprisals on the part of the German troops will deter the Belgian\\nGovernment from protesting before the civilized world against the\\nfearful and atrocious crimes committed wilfully and deliberately by the\\ninvading hosts against helpless non-combatants, old men, women, and\\nchildren.\\n\\n\\u201cLong is the list of outrages committed by the German troops and\\nappalling the details of atrocities, as vouched for by the Committee of\\nInquiry recently formed by the Belgian Minister of Justice and presided\\nover by him. This committee comprises the highest judicial and\\nUniversity authorities of Belgium, such as Chief Justice Van Iseghem,\\nJudge Nys, Professors Cottier, Wodon, etc.\\n\\n\\u201cThe following instances and particulars have been established by\\ncareful investigations, based in each case on the evidence of reliable\\neye-witnesses:--\\n\\n\\u201cGerman cavalry occupying the village of Linsmeau were attacked by some\\nBelgian infantry and two gendarmes. A German officer was killed by our\\ntroops during the fight and subsequently buried at the request of the\\nBelgian officer in command. No one of the civilian population took part\\nin the fighting at Linsmeau. Nevertheless, the village was invaded at\\ndusk on August 10th by a strong force of German cavalry, artillery, and\\nmachine guns.\\n\\n\\u201cIn spite of the formal assurances given by the Burgomaster of Linsmeau\\nthat none of the peasants had taken part in the previous fight, two\\nfarms and six outlying houses were destroyed by gun fire and burnt. All\\nthe male inhabitants were then compelled to come forward and hand over\\nwhatever arms they possessed. No recently discharged firearms were\\nfound.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\u201c=Nevertheless, the invaders divided these peasants into three groups;\\nthose in one group were bound, and eleven of them placed in a ditch,\\nwhere they were afterwards found dead, their skulls fractured by the\\nbutts of German rifles.=\\n\\n\\u201c=During the night of August 10th German cavalry entered Velm in great\\nnumbers. The inhabitants were asleep. The Germans, without provocation,\\nfired on M. Deglimme Gevers\\u2019 house, broke into it, destroyed furniture,\\nlooted money, burnt barns, hay and corn stacks, farm implements, six\\noxen, and the contents of the farmyard. They carried off Mrs. Deglimme,\\nhalf naked, to a place two miles away. She was then let go, and was\\nfired upon as she fled, without being hit. Her husband was carried away\\nin another direction and fired upon. He is dying. The same troops sacked\\nand burned the house of a railway watchman.=\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\u201cFarmer Jef Dierick, of Neerhespen, bears witness to the following acts\\nof cruelty committed by German cavalry at Orsmael and Neerhespen on\\nAugust 10th, 11th, and 12th:--\\n\\n\\u201c=An old man of the latter village had his arm sliced in three\\nlongitudinal cuts; he was then hanged head downwards and burned alive.\\nYoung girls have been raped and little children outraged at Orsmael,\\nwhere several inhabitants suffered mutilations too horrible to describe.\\nA Belgian soldier belonging to a battalion of cyclist carabiniers, who\\nhad been wounded and made prisoner, was hanged; whilst another, who was\\ntending his comrade, was bound to a telegraph pole on the St. Trond road\\nand shot.=\\n\\n\\u201cOn Wednesday, August 12th, after an engagement at Haelen, Commandant\\nVan Damme, so severely wounded that he was lying prone on his back, was\\nfinally murdered by German infantrymen firing their revolvers into his\\nmouth.\\n\\n\\u201cOn Monday, August 10th, at Orsmael, the Germans picked up Commandant\\nKnapen, very seriously wounded, propped him up against a tree, and shot\\nhim. Finally they hacked his corpse with swords.\\n\\n\\u201cIn different places, notably at Hollogue sur Geer, Barchon, Pontisse,\\nHaelen, and Zelck, German troops have fired on doctors, ambulance\\nbearers, ambulances, and ambulance wagons carrying the Red Cross.\\n\\n\\u201cAt Boncelles a body of German troops marched into battle carrying a\\nBelgian flag.\\n\\n     WHY THE GERMANS COMMIT ATROCITIES.\\n\\n     \\u201c=True strategy consists in hitting your enemy, and hitting him\\n     hard. Above all you must inflict on the inhabitants of invaded\\n     towns the maximum of suffering, so that they may become sick of the\\n     struggle and may bring pressure to bear on their Government to\\n     discontinue it. You must leave the people through whom you march\\n     only their eyes to weep with.=\\n\\n     \\u201c=In every case the principle which guided our general was that war\\n     must be made terrible to the civil population, so that it may sue\\n     for peace.=\\u201d\\n\\n        =BISMARCK.=\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cOn Thursday, August 6th, before a fort at Li\\xe9ge, German soldiers\\ncontinued to fire on a party of Belgian soldiers (who were unarmed, and\\nhad been surrounded while digging a trench) after these had hoisted the\\nwhite flag.\\n\\n\\u201cOn the same day, at Vottem, near the fort of Loncin, a group of German\\ninfantry hoisted the white flag. When Belgian soldiers approached to\\ntake them prisoners the Germans suddenly opened fire on them at close\\nrange.\\n\\n\\u201cHarrowing reports of German savagery at Aerschot have reached the\\nBelgian Government at Antwerp from official local sources. Thus on\\nTuesday, August 18th, the Belgian troops occupying a position in front\\nof Aerschot received orders to retire without engaging the enemy. A\\nsmall force was left behind to cover the retreat. This force resisted\\nvaliantly against overwhelming German forces, and inflicted serious\\nlosses on them. Meanwhile, practically the whole civilian population of\\nAerschot, terrorized by the atrocities committed by the Germans in the\\nneighbouring villages, had fled from the town.\\n\\n\\u201cNext day, Wednesday, August 19th, German troops entered Aerschot,\\nwithout a shot having been fired from the town and without any\\nresistance whatever having been made. The few inhabitants that remained\\nhad closed their doors and windows in compliance with the general orders\\nissued by the Belgian Government. Nevertheless, the Germans broke into\\nthe houses and told the inhabitants to quit.\\n\\n\\u201c=In one single street the first six male inhabitants who crossed their\\nthresholds were seized and shot at once, under the very eyes of their\\nwives and children.=\\n\\n\\u201cThe German troops then retired for the day, only to return in greater\\nnumbers on the next day, Thursday, August 20th.\\n\\n\\u201cThey then compelled the inhabitants to leave their houses and marched\\nthem to a place two hundred yards from the town. There, without more\\nado, they shot M. Thielemans, the Burgomaster, his fifteen-year-old son,\\nthe clerk of the local judicial board, and ten prominent citizens. They\\nthen set fire to the town and destroyed it.\\n\\n\\u201cThe following statement was made by Commandant Georges Gilson, of the\\n9th Infantry of the Line, now lying in hospital at Antwerp:--\\n\\n\\u201cI was told to cover the retreat of our troops in front of Aerschot.\\nDuring the action fought there on Wednesday, August 19th, between six\\nand eight o\\u2019clock in the morning, suddenly I saw on the high road,\\nbetween the German and Belgian forces, which were fighting at close\\nrange, a group of four women, with babies in their arms, and two little\\ngirls clinging to their skirts. Our men stopped firing till the women\\ngot through our lines, but the German machine guns went on firing all\\nthe time, and one of the women was wounded in the arm.\\n\\n\\u201c=These women could not have got through the neighbouring German lines\\nand been on the high road unless with the consent of the enemy.=\\n\\n\\u201c=All the evidence and circumstances seem to point to the fact that these\\nwomen had been deliberately pushed forward by the Germans to act as a\\nshield for their advance guard, and in the hope that the Belgians would\\ncease firing for fear of killing the women and children.=\\n\\n\\u201cThis statement was made and duly certified in the Antwerp hospital on\\nAugust 22nd by Commandant Gilson in the presence of the Chevalier Ernst\\nN. Bunswyck, Chief Secretary to the Belgian Minister of Justice, and M.\\nde Cartier de Marchienne, Belgian Minister to China.\\n\\n\\u201cFurther German atrocities were continuously being brought to notice and\\nmade the subject of official and expert inquiry by the proper\\nauthorities.\\n\\n\\u201cIn publishing the above statements the only comment the Press Bureau\\ncan offer is, that these atrocities appear to be committed in villages\\nand throughout the countryside with the deliberate intention of\\nterrorizing the people, and so making it unnecessary to leave troops in\\noccupation of small places, or to protect lines of communication. _In\\nlarger places, like Brussels, where the diplomatic representatives of\\nneutral Powers are eye-witnesses, there appear to have been no\\nexcesses._\\u201d\\n\\n=Such was the document issued by the Press Bureau. I have quoted it word\\nfor word= (emphasizing only in italics or in heavy type certain\\npassages).\\n\\n     PRIMITIVE SAVAGERY.\\n\\n     \\u201c=Their utter contempt for the established usages of international\\n     intercourse, and even for the ordinary decencies of life, was\\n     displayed in their brutal treatment of the French and Russian\\n     Ambassadors, in the stripping naked of the wives of Russian\\n     officials, in the atrocities they have since committed in Belgium,\\n     in their seizure of hostages, in their homicidal mine-laying in the\\n     North Sea. In all these matters one seems to discern a sudden lapse\\n     into primitive savagery.=\\u201d\\n\\n        --Dr. Dillon in the _Contemporary Review_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\n\\nThe following is the second report issued by the Belgian Commission of\\nInquiry, and which was published by the British Official Press Bureau on\\nSeptember 15th, 1914.\\n\\n\\nSecond Report of the Belgian Committee of Inquiry.\\n\\nTo M. Carton de Wiart, Minister of Justice, Antwerp.\\n\\nSir,--The Commission of Inquiry has the honour to make the following\\nreport on acts of which the town of Louvain, the neighbourhood, and the\\ndistrict of Malines have been the scene.\\n\\nThe German Army entered Louvain on Wednesday, August 19th, after having\\nburned down the villages through which it had passed.\\n\\nAs soon as they had entered the town of Louvain the Germans\\nrequisitioned food and lodging for their troops. They went to all the\\nbanks of the town and took possession of the cash in hand. German\\nsoldiers burst open the doors of houses which had been abandoned by\\ntheir inhabitants, pillaged them, and committed other excesses.\\n\\nThe German authorities took as hostages the mayor of the city, Senator\\nVan der Kelen, the Vice-Rector of the Catholic University, and the\\nsenior priest of the city, besides certain magistrates and aldermen.\\nAll the weapons possessed by the inhabitants, even fencing swords, had\\nalready been given up to the municipal authorities and placed by them in\\nthe Church of St. Pierre.\\n\\nIn a neighbouring village, Corbeek Loo, on Wednesday, August 19th, a\\nyoung woman, aged twenty-two, whose husband was with the Army, and some\\nof her relations, were surprised by a band of German soldiers. The\\npersons who were with her were locked up in a deserted house, while she\\nherself was dragged into another cottage, where she was assaulted by\\nfive soldiers.\\n\\n\\nFate of 16-year-old Girl.\\n\\nIn the same village on Thursday, August 20, German soldiers fetched from\\ntheir house a young girl, about sixteen years old, and her parents. They\\nconducted them to a small deserted country house, and while some of them\\nheld back the father and mother, others entered the house, and, finding\\nthe cellar open, forced the girl to drink. They then brought her on to\\nthe lawn in front of the house and assaulted her. Finally they stabbed\\nher in the breast with their bayonets.\\n\\nWhen this young girl had been abandoned by them after these abominable\\ndeeds, she was brought back to her parents\\u2019 house, and the following\\nday, in view of the gravity of her condition, she received extreme\\nunction from the parish priest and was taken to the hospital of\\nLouvain, as her life was despaired of.\\n\\nOn August 24 and 25 Belgian troops made a sortie from the entrenched\\ncamp of Antwerp and attacked the German army before Malines. The Germans\\nwere thrown back on Louvain and Vilvorde.\\n\\nOn entering the villages which had been occupied by the enemy the\\nBelgian army found them devastated. The Germans, as they retired, had\\npillaged and burnt the villages, taking with them the male inhabitants,\\nwhom they forced to march in front of them.\\n\\nBelgian soldiers entering Hofstade on August 25 found the body of an old\\nwoman who had been killed by bayonet thrusts. She still held in her hand\\nthe needle with which she was sewing when she was killed. A woman and\\nher fifteen or sixteen year old son lay on the ground, pierced by\\nbayonets. A man had been hanged.\\n\\nAt Sempst, a neighbouring village, were found the bodies of two men\\npartially carbonised. One of them had his legs cut off at the knees; the\\nother had the arms and legs cut off. A workman, whose burnt body has\\nbeen seen by several witnesses, had been struck several times with\\nbayonets, and then, while still alive, the Germans had poured petroleum\\nover him and thrown him into a house to which they set fire. A woman who\\ncame out of her house was killed in the same way.\\n\\nA witness, whose evidence has been taken by a reliable British subject,\\ndeclares that he saw, on August 26, not far from Malines, during the\\nlast Belgian attack, an old man tied by the arms to one of the rafters\\nin the ceiling of his farm. The body was completely carbonised, but the\\nhead, arms, and feet were unburnt. Further on, a child of about fifteen\\nwas tied up, the hands behind the back, and the body was completely torn\\nopen with bayonet wounds. Numerous corpses of peasants lay on the ground\\nin positions of supplication, their arms lifted and their hands clasped.\\n\\n\\nFacts about Louvain.\\n\\nAt nightfall on August 26 the German troops, repulsed by our soldiers,\\nentered Louvain panic-stricken. Several witnesses affirm that the German\\ngarrison which occupied Louvain was erroneously informed that the enemy\\nwere entering the town. Men of the garrison immediately marched to the\\nstation, shooting haphazard the while, and there met the German troops\\nwho had been repulsed by the Belgians, the latter having just ceased the\\npursuit.\\n\\nEverything tends to prove that the German regiments fired on one\\nanother. At once the Germans began bombarding the town, pretending that\\ncivilians had fired on the troops, a suggestion which is contradicted by\\nall the witnesses, and could scarcely have been possible, because the\\ninhabitants of Louvain had had to give up their arms to the municipal\\nauthorities several days before.\\n\\nThe bombardment lasted till about ten o\\u2019clock at night. The Germans then\\nset fire to the town. Wherever the fire had not spread, the German\\nsoldiers entered the houses and threw fire grenades, with which some of\\nthem seemed to be provided. The greater part of the town of Louvain was\\nthus a prey to the flames, particularly the quarters of the upper town,\\ncomprising the modern buildings, the ancient Cathedral of St. Pierre,\\nthe university buildings, together with the university library, its\\nmanuscripts and collections, and the municipal theatre.\\n\\nThe Commission considers it its duty to insist, in the midst of all\\nthese horrors, on the crime committed against civilisation by the\\ndeliberate destruction of an academic library which was one of the\\ntreasures of Europe.\\n\\nThe corpses of many civilians encumbered the streets and squares. On the\\nroad from Tirlemont to Louvain alone a witness counted more than fifty.\\nOn the doorsteps of houses could be seen carbonised bodies of\\ninhabitants, who, hiding in their cellars, were driven out by the fire,\\ntried to escape, and fell into the flames. The suburbs of Louvain\\nsuffered the same fate.\\n\\nWe can affirm that the houses in all the districts between Louvain and\\nMalines, and most of the suburbs of Louvain itself, have practically\\nbeen destroyed.\\n\\n\\nThousands Sent to Germany.\\n\\nOn Wednesday morning, August 26th, the Germans brought to the station\\nsquares of Louvain a group of more than seventy-five persons, including\\nseveral prominent citizens of the town, among whom were Father Coloboet\\nand another Spanish priest, and also an American priest.\\n\\nThe men were brutally separated from their wives and children, and after\\nhaving been subjected to the most abominable treatment by the Germans,\\nwho several times threatened to shoot them, they were forced to march to\\nthe village of Campenhout in front of the German troops. They were shut\\nup in the village church, where they passed the night.\\n\\nAbout four o\\u2019clock the next morning a German officer told them they had\\nbetter go to confession, as they would be shot half an hour later. About\\nhalf-past four they were liberated. Shortly afterwards they were again\\narrested by a German brigade, which forced them to march before them in\\nthe direction of Malines. In reply to a question of one of the\\nprisoners, a German officer said they were going to give them a taste of\\nthe Belgian quickfirers before Antwerp. They were at last released on\\nthe Thursday afternoon at the gates of Malines.\\n\\nIt appears from other witnesses that several thousand male inhabitants\\nof Louvain, who had escaped the shooting and the fire, were sent to\\nGermany for a purpose which is still unknown to us.\\n\\n\\nEye-Witness\\u2019s Account.\\n\\nThe fire at Louvain burnt for several days. An eye-witness who left\\nLouvain on August 30th gave the following description of the town at\\nthat time:--\\u201cLeaving Weert St. George\\u2019s, I only saw burnt-down villages\\nand half-crazy peasants, who on meeting anyone held up their hands as a\\nsign of submission. Before every house, even those burnt down, hung a\\nwhite flag, and the burnt rags of them could be seen among the ruins.\\n\\n\\u201cAt Weert St. George\\u2019s I questioned the inhabitants on the causes of the\\nGerman reprisals, and they affirmed most positively that no inhabitant\\nhad fired a shot, that in any case the arms had been previously\\ncollected, but that the Germans had taken vengeance on the population\\nbecause a Belgian soldier belonging to the gendarmerie had killed an\\nUhlan.\\n\\n\\u201cThe population still remaining in Louvain have taken refuge in the\\nsuburb of H\\xe9verl\\xe9, where they are extremely crowded. They have been\\ncleared out of the town by the troops and the fire.\\n\\n\\u201cThe fire started a little beyond the American College, and the town is\\n_entirely_ destroyed, except for the town hall and the station.\\nFurthermore, the fire was still burning to-day, and the Germans, far\\nfrom taking any steps to stop it, seemed to feed it with straw, an\\ninstance of which I observed in the street adjoining the town hall.\\n\\n\\u201cThe cathedral and the theatre are destroyed and have fallen in, as also\\nthe library; in short, the town has the appearance of an ancient ruined\\ncity, in the midst of which only a few drunken soldiers move about,\\ncarrying bottles of wine and liqueurs, while the officers themselves,\\nseated in arm-chairs round the tables, drink like their men.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Commission has not yet been able to obtain information about the\\nfate of the Mayor of Louvain and of the other notables who were taken as\\nhostages.\\n\\nThe Commission is able to draw the following conclusions from the facts\\nwhich have so far been brought to its notice:--\\n\\nIn this war, the occupation of any place is systematically accompanied\\nand followed, sometimes even preceded, by acts of violence towards the\\ncivil population, which acts are contrary both to the usages of war and\\nto the most elementary principles of humanity.\\n\\n\\nBrutality Everywhere.\\n\\nThe German procedure is everywhere the same. They advance along a road,\\nshooting inoffensive passers-by--particularly bicyclists--as well as\\npeasants working in the fields.\\n\\nIn the towns or villages where they stop they begin by requisitioning\\nfood and drink, which they consume till intoxicated.\\n\\nSometimes from the interior of deserted houses they let off their rifles\\nat random and declare that it was the inhabitants who fired. Then the\\nscenes of fire, murder, and especially pillage begin, accompanied by\\nacts of deliberate cruelty, without respect to sex or age. Even where\\nthey pretend to know the actual person guilty of the acts they allege,\\nthey do not content themselves with executing him summarily, but they\\nseize the opportunity to decimate the population, pillage the houses,\\nand then set them on fire.\\n\\nAfter a preliminary attack and massacre they shut up the men in the\\nchurch, and then order the women to return to their houses and to leave\\ntheir doors open all night.\\n\\nFrom several places the male population has been sent to Germany, there\\nto be forced, it appears, to work at the harvest, as in the old days of\\nslavery. There are many cases of the inhabitants being forced to act as\\nguides and to dig trenches and entrenchments for the Germans. Numerous\\nwitnesses assert that during their marches, and even when attacking, the\\nGermans place civilians, men and women, in their front ranks, in order\\nto prevent our soldiers firing.\\n\\nThe evidence of Belgian officers and soldiers shows that German\\ndetachments do not hesitate to display either the white flag or the Red\\nCross flag in order to approach our troops with impunity. On the other\\nhand, they fire on our ambulances and maltreat the ambulance men. They\\nmaltreat and even kill the wounded. The clergy seem to be particularly\\nchosen as subjects for their brutality.\\n\\nFinally, we have in our possession expanding bullets which had been\\nabandoned by the enemy at Werchter, and we possess doctors\\u2019 certificates\\nshowing that wounds must have been inflicted by bullets of this kind.\\n\\nThe documents and evidence on which these conclusions rest will be\\npublished in due course.\\n\\n     (Signed)\\n\\n     The President, COOREMAN.\\n\\n     Members of the Commission, COUNT GOBLET D\\u2019ALVIELLA, RYCKMANS,\\n     STRAUSS, VAN CUTSEM.\\n\\n     Secretaries, CHEV.

They\\n     themselves have transgressed every law of God and man.=\\u201d\\n\\n        --From the _Daily Mail_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV.\\n\\nCan These Things Be True?\\n\\n\\nCan these cold-blooded deeds of atrocity be true? Is it a fact that they\\nhave been proved to the satisfaction of the most exacting critics? Is\\nthis \\u201cwelter of fire, blood, and destruction\\u201d to be written finally on\\nthe pages of history?\\n\\nI can only say this:\\n\\n1. These stories came to us first from responsible correspondents of all\\nour leading newspapers, who took them down for the most part at first\\nhand from eye-witnesses and from the poor victims themselves.\\n\\n2. A committee of eminent lawyers, assisted by the Belgian Minister of\\nJustice, made a searching inquiry, sifting vague reports from actual\\nfacts.\\n\\n3. The evidence of the atrocities thus collected was formulated in an\\nOfficial Report to be presented to the President of the United States by\\nthe Belgian Delegation of Ministers of State, now on their way to\\nAmerica.\\n\\n4. The British Official Press Bureau issued, on the 25th August, a\\nstatement of the representations made to them, which I have already\\nquoted.\\n\\n5. The Report of the Belgian Government was confirmed by the French\\nprotest against German atrocities which was addressed on September 2nd\\nto the Powers by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\\n\\n6. Mr. Richard Harding Davis, an eminent American author and\\ncorrespondent in Belgium of the _New York Tribune_, has entirely\\nconfirmed, in cables sent to this leading American journal, things he\\nhas seen with his own eyes.\\n\\n7. I have narrated the information given to me verbally by M. Van der\\nVelde himself. \\u201cI myself examined the bodies of a peasant and his son\\nwhich have been cut to pieces by bayonet thrusts.\\u201d\\n\\n8. While at first the reports of these atrocities were received in this\\ncountry with some reserve, the accumulated and overwhelming evidence,\\naggravated from day to day since the very commencement of the war, has\\nprovoked the public men of England, and every responsible newspaper in\\nthe country, as well as all our leading weeklies like the _Spectator_,\\nthe _Saturday Review_, the _Nation_, the _British Weekly_, and others,\\ninto a passionate protest against the inhuman and barbarous methods of\\nwarfare that have stained the name of Germany for ever.\\n\\n9. Germany herself has admitted her wanton deeds, and sought to excuse\\nthem in a way that makes her guilt all the more deplorable. We are told\\nthat these barbarian atrocities against the civil population and\\nunoffending peasants, the sacking, looting, and burning of towns and\\nvillages, are part of the general plan of attack, and that they are\\naccomplished in cold blood for purely strategical considerations.\\nUnfortunately they are not merely the riotous and isolated outbursts of\\nmarauding and buccaneering soldiers.\\n\\n\\u201cThe only means of preventing surprise attacks from the civil population\\nhas been to interfere with unrelenting severity and to create examples\\nwhich by their frightfulness would be a warning to the whole country.\\u201d\\nTo prevent \\u201csurprise attacks\\u201d tortures were inflicted on helpless old\\nmen, women, and children, peaceful villagers were hanged, innocent\\nchildren were savagely sabred by German officers, wounded soldiers and\\nofficers shot and mutilated. There was the burning of Vis\\xe9 and the\\nterrible massacre at Seraing, the sacking and plundering of many another\\nharmless village, the bombardment of Malines, and the crowning sacrilege\\nof all, the burning and sacking of Louvain, the torture and massacre of\\nits defenceless people. Abler pens than mine have told the story of\\nthese blood-guilty ruffians, and abler historians will yet chronicle for\\nfuture generations the record of the modern Huns of Attila. \\u201cFor every\\nvile deed wrought under the impious benedictions of the monarch who is\\nravaging Europe ample reparation will be exacted.... The memory of them\\nwill burn in the heart and mind of every Englishman.\\u201d So said the\\n_Times_. I affirm this is the feeling of every true Britisher.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI.\\n\\n\\n=It is specially forbidden \\u201cTo kill or wound an enemy who, having laid\\ndown his arms, or having no longer means of defence, has surrendered at\\ndiscretion. To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national\\nflag, or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy.\\u201d--Hague\\nConvention, Article XXIII.=\\n\\n\\nWanton Brutality.\\n\\nI have made it plain from the official documents I have quoted that the\\nGerman troops violated every item of this article. But in addition to\\ncases of brutality already cited in the official document, the Belgian\\nMission, while in London, gave me the following:--\\n\\nOn August 19th Aerschot, in North Brabant, with about five thousand\\ninhabitants, was, as already reported, destroyed. It appears that during\\nthe three days the German soldiery massacred and pillaged the town,\\nwhich had not resisted, although there was no military force there\\nwhatever.\\n\\nIn the neighbouring village of Diest many of the inhabitants were put to\\nthe sword. The wife of Francis Luyckx, aged forty-five, and her\\ndaughter, twelve years of age, had, in their terror, taken refuge in a\\nsewer. They were discovered, dragged out, and shot.\\n\\nThe little daughter of Jean Oyyen, a pretty child of nine, was shot, and\\na man named Andre Willem, aged twenty-three, the village sexton, was\\nbound to a tree and burned alive.\\n\\nIn the village of Schaffen, near Diest, two men, named Lodts and Marken,\\nboth aged forty, were captured and entombed. When exhumed, it was\\nfound that they had been buried alive, head downwards. These\\noccurrences--which are only a few of a very long list--had been fully\\ninquired into, and confirmed by the committee of investigation, which\\nwas composed of the highest magistrates of Belgium and the chief\\nprofessors of the Universities.\\n\\nStatements were made that aged villagers in many places on the\\nFranco-German frontier were hanged to trees; others, after being killed,\\nhad their eyes gouged out. In one place fifteen bodies were found\\nmutilated in a heap, and along the whole frontier from Luxemburg to\\nBasle outrages were committed on women, girls, and children.\\n\\nMlle. Marie Malet, the daughter of a judicial official in Brussels, who\\nhad been sent to London with a party of Belgian girls for safety, stated\\nthat she had seen a little girl, a friend of hers, aged ten, savagely\\nsabred by a German officer, merely because she made a remark that the\\nGermans were bullies. The child died an hour afterwards. Mlle. Malet\\nstated that she had been sent from near Brussels with her sister, owing\\nto the insults to which Belgian girls were subjected by German soldiers.\\nHer mother had been wounded and her home looted of food and valuables.\\n\\n[Illustration: BELGIAN PEASANTS WATCHING THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR HOMES\\nBY THE RUTHLESS INVADER.\\n\\n_Photo, Daily Mirror._]\\n\\nThe record of German atrocities in Belgium, indeed, rivals that of Alva\\nin the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. The worst Balkan methods\\nwere being pursued by the army of the pious Kaiser. At Pontillac,\\nbetween Li\\xe9ge and Namur, the Burgomaster officially reported that the\\nmen of the 17th Hussars from Mecklenburg entered the place, met with no\\nresistance, and demanded food, which the inhabitants at once gave them.\\nAfter eating and drinking to their full, to the surprise of everyone\\nthey rode wildly through the streets emptying their carbines at the\\nwindows of the houses. Two Belgian soldiers who were secreted in the\\nvillage returned their fire. A hot fusillade ensued, and then the\\nGermans deliberately shot down all the villagers they could find. They\\nalso seized a M. Lahaye, a member of the Communal Council, and dragged\\nhim through the streets with a rope round his neck.\\n\\n\\nDrunken German Soldiers.\\n\\nFurther details regarding the wild savagery at Aerschot reached the\\nBelgian Government after the issuing of the official report printed in\\nthe foregoing pages. It seems that the population of the Belgian\\nprovinces overrun by the Germans suffered, not only from the outrages of\\nthe troops acting under the orders of their officers, but also from\\natrocities due to drunken soldiers.\\n\\nIn one town some of them fired their rifles openly into the air and\\nafterwards declared that the inhabitants had fired on them. On this\\npretext the people were dragged from their houses, which were then set\\non fire, and in many cases women and girls were outraged and the men\\nshot. At Aerschot the troops--upon whom the Kaiser and the Austrian\\nEmperor were beseeching God\\u2019s blessing--stabled their horses in the\\nchurch, one of the most beautiful in Belgium, while the troops were set\\nto work to destroy the pictures and fittings in the noble edifice. The\\nGermans accused the son of the Burgomaster of killing the son of a\\nGerman colonel. This was denied by the Burgomaster\\u2019s son, who only fired\\nto defend his mother and sister from gross insults by the soldiery.\\n\\n     \\u201c=For every evil and unwarrantable act committed in the Western\\n     theatre, ample vengeance will be exacted at the other\\n     end.=\\u201d--_Times._\\n\\n\\nThe Germans, however, surrounded the town. The inhabitants were then\\ndragged from their homes and the women separated from the men. The\\nlatter were divided into batches and forced to run towards the river,\\nthe troops laughing at them and firing at them as they ran. One man who\\nescaped by feigning death afterwards returned and counted forty-one\\nbodies of his friends. Many of them had been stabbed by bayonets after\\nbeing wounded. About one hundred and fifty of the male inhabitants of\\nthis place were compelled to watch the German troops shoot the\\nBurgomaster, his son, and the Burgomaster\\u2019s brother.\\n\\n\\nWomen Mutilated.\\n\\nMr. Adolph Coussmaekrs, a well-known resident of Antwerp, wrote giving\\nnine cases of atrocities committed by the Germans in the districts of\\nOrsmael and Barchon.\\n\\nI do not reproduce here the nine cases instanced by this gentleman. The\\nwanton mutilation on women and children is revolting and seems\\nincredible.\\n\\nIn addition, there were criminal assaults on women which I cannot dwell\\nupon in these pages; they have been narrated by unimpeachable persons.\\nMothers had their daughters dragged away from them by shameless officers\\nto a fate that must have driven them to despair. Women and young\\nchildren were injured by bayonet-thrusts and revolver-shots, and were\\nstill suffering from their wounds.\\n\\n     \\u201c=In no war of modern times has an enemy so distinguished himself by\\n     war on civilians as in this.

He\\nstated that on the day of their entry the Germans posted an order on the\\nstreets that all arms in possession of private persons must be\\nimmediately delivered, under the threat of being shot. The inhabitants\\ncomplied with the order. Among others, collections of old arms were\\nbrought, valued sometimes at hundreds of pounds. The new vandals\\ndestroyed all these pitilessly.\\n\\n\\u201cDuring the first days the Germans paid for everything they took. But\\nlater on soldiers produced valueless pieces of paper, on which something\\nhad been scribbled which could hardly be read. On Sunday, August 23rd,\\nat midnight, the inhabitants were suddenly awakened by soldiers knocking\\nat the doors. \\u2018We need immediately two hundred and fifty mattresses, two\\nhundred pounds of coffee, two hundred and fifty loaves of bread, and\\nfive hundred eggs,\\u2019 they said. \\u2018If these are not delivered in an hour\\u2019s\\ntime your hostages will be shot.\\u2019 Everybody rushed to the market-place,\\nmany people in their night clothes. There stood the mayor, half-dressed.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter the inhabitants had brought in everything which was demanded they\\nwere informed that the whole was a mistake and that they could go to\\nbed. The old mayor, however, was detained the whole night in the\\nstreet.\\n\\n\\u201cOne day when the soldiers sat down to dinner, an alarm was suddenly\\nbeaten in the streets. Soldiers from all the houses were summoned to\\ntheir regiments. Immediately after, the bombardment of the houses began.\\nThe informant took refuge with his wife and children in a cellar, which\\nwas constantly filled with smoke from the neighbouring houses, which had\\ncaught fire. On Wednesday morning the bombardment ceased and they\\nventured to the station.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, notwithstanding his protests, and proposals to produce papers,\\nshowing that he was a Dutch subject, the cigarette manufacturer was\\nseparated from his family, of whom he has since lost sight. He was\\nsurrounded by soldiers, who bound his hands behind his back, and with\\nother refugees he was kept at the station many hours. During this time\\nhe saw a party of three hundred Belgian civilians, among whom were old\\nmen and lads of fourteen or fifteen, driven at the point of the bayonet\\nto a remote spot near the station, where they were all shot before his\\neyes.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter a terrible night, he and his group of seventy-six men were set\\nfree. They had had nothing to eat or drink for thirty-six hours. All\\nstreets and roads in and round Li\\xe9ge were strewn, according to the\\nwitness, with bodies of men, women, and children. Among those shot were\\nthe mayor, two aldermen, the rector of the University, two deans, and\\nmany police inspectors.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII.\\n\\n\\n     \\u201c=Our German people will be the grand block on which the good God\\n     may complete His work of civilizing the world.=\\u201d\\n\\n        From a speech of _The Kaiser\\u2019s_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Inferno at Vis\\xe9.\\n\\nA correspondent of the _Handelsblad_ was an eye-witness of the scenes in\\nVis\\xe9, near Li\\xe9ge, when it was burned, and told a tale of German\\nbarbarity, and of the murder and torture of its helpless inhabitants, of\\na nature to make one\\u2019s blood run cold.

According to these letters, the Germans alleged that the\\ncitizens had fired on the troops. All the inhabitants were then hunted\\nout of their houses to spend the night in the square watching the\\nburning. Men were taken prisoners, and possibly shot, and the rest were\\ndriven out of the town, which was given to the flames. Eysden is filled\\nwith refugees--one hundred and fifty in one canteen and two hundred and\\nfifty in the Protestant Church, while four hundred have been sent to\\nMaastricht.\\n\\n\\u201cTwo trainloads of refugees came into Brussels from the Tirlemont\\ndistrict.

Isadore Felix Cruls, a Belgian refugee who arrived in London, had a\\ntragic story to tell. He carried on a prosperous printing business at\\nSaint Joss\\xe9, a suburb of Brussels. When hostilities broke out he was\\ncalled up for service in the Civil Guard, and stationed on the Chauss\\xe9e\\nde Louvain, the road between Louvain and Brussels. As reported in the\\n_Daily Telegraph_, he stated:--\\n\\n\\u201cAt midnight on August 19th-20th I was on duty on the Chauss\\xe9e de\\nLouvain watching the refugees come in from the various towns and\\nvillages. The road was blocked when I got near. I saw that a party of\\nGerman Lancers were at the rear of the procession of refugees. I saw one\\nof the Lancers prodding a woman, who had four or five children walking\\nby her side.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was an old woman, evidently the mother of the young woman,\\nwalking with them. One of the Lancers was amusing himself by pricking\\nthis old woman with his lance in order to make her walk along more\\nquickly. The young woman turned round and shouted something at the\\nLancer, either by way of remonstrance or insult. I was not near enough\\nto hear what she said. The Lancer took up his lance and ran it through\\none of the little girls who was walking along, clutching the hand of her\\nmother. She was a fair-haired girl of about seven or eight years of age.\\nWhen the crowd saw this they became infuriated, and a panic ensued. The\\nLancers bore down upon the people, scattering them in all directions.\\nWhat became of these people I do not know.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX.\\n\\nThe Maiden Tribute.\\n\\n\\nAnother story M. Cruls related was told to him by the mother herself. At\\na village called Leau a squadron of about five hundred Uhlans was\\nmarching through the town when they declared that someone had fired at\\nthem. On going round to all the houses, searching for firearms, they\\ncame to one where the family circle consisted of a grandfather, the\\nfather, mother, and a girl of seventeen or eighteen, and a young boy,\\nwho, upon seeing the approach of the German soldiers, fled and hid\\nhimself. The soldiers came in, and without any questioning fired at and\\nkilled the father. They were going to shoot the grandfather when the\\nmother and daughter fell on their knees and begged the soldiers to spare\\nthe life of the old man. The officer, or under-officer, of the party\\nthen said, \\u201cYes, we won\\u2019t trouble about the old people,\\u201d and touching\\nthe cheek of the young girl with his fingers, he added, with a\\nsignificant laugh, \\u201cPretty youth is better.\\u201d The sequel need not be\\nwritten here, although the mother of the girl has told it.\\n\\n\\nA Governess Hanged.\\n\\nA well-known family in Brussels were staying at their villa at Genck,\\nabout six kilometres from the capital. On arrival of the Germans there\\nthey entered the villa, smashed everything they could, and stole\\nwhatever was of value, \\u201ceven taking away the wedding-ring that the\\nhusband wore on his finger.\\u201d They took away the men first, and nobody\\nknows what has become of them. A member of the family and two servants\\nfled from the house in terror, but returned when they saw the German\\nsoldiers going.\\n\\nThis is what they saw: \\u201cThe body of an old lady of seventy years of age\\nlying on the floor with her throat cut. A governess, about thirty years\\nof age--I cannot tell you her nationality--was found hanging from a\\ntree, stark naked and mutilated.\\u201d\\n\\nAlthough this happened within six kilometres of Brussels, yet no\\natrocities were known to have been committed in the capital, the\\nKaiser\\u2019s unrestrained savages being there under the eyes of the\\nrepresentatives of the Powers.\\n\\nA Dutch gentleman named Couzy, of Amsterdam, was staying at Mont, a\\nvillage in the hills above Comblain au Pont, when war broke out. Having\\nmissed the last train which the Belgians ran to Dinant, he was obliged\\nto return to Mont, where he witnessed the arrival of thousands of Uhlans\\nand many batteries of German artillery. Mr. Couzy declared that the\\ntreatment of the Belgians by the enemy was merciless. He was witness of\\nmany horrible scenes. He was present when, after the discovery of the\\nbodies of two German officers in a horse-dealer\\u2019s yard at Comblain au\\nPont, seventy villagers were brought before the commanding officer.\\nWithout question, the officer selected thirty, who were shot without\\nany form of trial whatever. Several of these men were known to Mr. Couzy\\nas honest and trustworthy citizens.\\n\\nOn another occasion a number of villagers were searched for weapons. A\\nyoung Dutchman, also known to Mr. Couzy, had upon him a razor which he\\nused daily. Immediately he was placed against a wall and shot.\\n\\nA refugee arriving at Maastricht from Bassenge stated that ten thousand\\nGermans came from the direction of Louvain, and began to burn everything\\nthat had been left standing and shoot everyone opposed to them. Two\\nhundred of the villagers were driven out by the Germans and ordered to\\nhold their hands above their heads. Anyone who dropped his hands for an\\ninstant was shot, and anyone who looked at or showed sympathy with the\\nvictims shared the same fate. They were marched for two hours, and\\nduring that time many shots whistled over their heads. The Germans then\\nstopped and threatened that the first who looked back would be shot.\\n\\n\\nA Senator\\u2019s Story.\\n\\n\\u201cM. Leon Hiard, senator of Hainaut, one of the largest manufacturers in\\nBelgium, lived at Haine Saint Pierre, where before the battle of Mons\\nthe Germans requisitioned everything. He states that, revolver in hand,\\nthreatening death for unpunctuality or disobedience, the German officers\\nspread terror into the hearts of the inhabitants. At Peronne the mayor,\\nM. Gravis, had very imprudently caused all the arms of the inhabitants\\nto be deposited at his house instead of the town-hall. He also carried\\na revolver, and some of his carts had been used to bar a road.\\u201d The\\n_Daily Express_ correspondent continues--\\n\\n\\u201cHe was taken before the German general at the town-hall with his\\nsecretary. The s\\xe9ance was short. \\u2018Vous fusill\\xe9,\\u2019 said the general, and\\nthe unfortunate man was led out blindfolded and shot. As the secretary\\nwas following him a more kindly officer said in his ear, \\u2018Mais\\nfilez-donc, imb\\xe9cile,\\u2019 and pushed him on one side.\\n\\n\\u201cThe body of M. Gravis was propped up against a wall for forty-eight\\nhours as an example to the town. Men were billeted in all the houses,\\nand although in the better houses the officers behaved with some\\nrestraint, in the peasants\\u2019 cottages unbridled licence was the rule.\\n\\n\\u201cWomen were treated infamously, indescribable scenes of debauchery\\ntaking place, while all the possessions of the unfortunates were\\nwilfully wasted and destroyed. The fiery-tempered people were being\\ndriven to reprisals, so that an excuse for further cruelty might be\\nfound.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nWhat General von Boehn said.\\n\\nI take the following extract from a long dispatch in the _Daily\\nChronicle_, from Mr. E. Alexander Powell, the Special Correspondent of\\nthe _New York World_:--\\n\\n\\u201cThree weeks ago the Government of Belgium requested me to place before\\nthe American people, through the medium of the _New York World_, a list\\nof specific and authenticated atrocities committed by German armies\\nupon Belgian non-combatants.\\n\\n\\u201cTo-day General von Boehn, commanding the Ninth Imperial Field Army, and\\nacting as mouthpiece of the German General Staff, has asked me to place\\nbefore the American people the German version of the incidents in\\nquestion....\\n\\n\\u201cGeneral von Boehn began by asserting that the accounts of the\\natrocities perpetrated on Belgian non-combatants were a tissue of lies.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Look at these officers about you,\\u2019 he said; \\u2018they are gentlemen like\\nyourselves. Look at the soldiers marching past in the road out there.\\nThey are most of them the fathers of families. Surely you do not believe\\nthat they would do the things they have been accused of.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Three days ago, General,\\u2019 I said, \\u2018I was in Aerschot. The whole town\\nis now but a ghastly, blackened, bloodstained ruin!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018When we entered Aerschot,\\u2019 he replied, \\u2018the son of the Burgomaster\\ncame into the room, drew a revolver, and assassinated my Chief of Staff.\\nWhat followed was only retribution. The townspeople only got what they\\ndeserved!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018But why wreak your vengeance on women and children?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018None have been killed,\\u2019 the General asserted positively.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018I\\u2019m sorry to contradict you, General,\\u2019 I asserted, with equal\\npositiveness, \\u2018but I have myself seen their mutilated bodies. So has Mr.\\nGibson, Secretary of the American Legation at Brussels, who was present\\nduring the destruction of Louvain.\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\u201cIt is War!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Of course, there is always danger of women and children being killed\\nduring street fighting,\\u2019 said the General, \\u2018if they insist on coming\\ninto the street. It is unfortunate, but it is war.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018But how about the woman whose body I saw with the hands and feet cut\\noff? How about the white-haired man and his son whom I helped to bury\\noutside of Sempst, and who had been killed merely because the retreating\\nBelgians had shot a German soldier outside their house? There were 22\\nbayonet wounds in the old man\\u2019s face. I counted them. How about the\\nlittle girl, two years old, shot while in her mother\\u2019s arms by a Uhlan,\\nand whose funeral I attended at Heyst-op-den-Berg? How about the old man\\nthat was hung from the rafters of his house by the hands and roasted to\\ndeath by a bonfire being built under him?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cThe General seemed somewhat taken aback by the amount and exactness of\\nmy data. \\u2018Such things are horrible if they are true,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Of\\ncourse, our soldiers, like soldiers in all armies, sometimes get out of\\nhand, and do things which we would never tolerate if we knew it. At\\nLouvain, for example, I sentenced two soldiers to 12 years\\u2019 penal\\nservitude apiece for assaulting a woman.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Apropos of Louvain,\\u2019 I remarked, \\u2018why did you destroy the library? It\\nwas one of the literary store-houses of the world.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018We regretted that as much as anyone else,\\u2019 answered the General. \\u2018It\\ncaught fire from the burning houses, and we could not save it.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018But why did you burn Louvain at all?\\u2019 I asked.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Because the townspeople fired on our troops. We actually found\\nmachine-guns in some of the houses; and,\\u2019 smashing his fist down upon\\nthe table, \\u2018whenever civilians fire upon our troops we will teach them a\\nlasting lesson. If the women and children insist on getting in the way\\nof bullets, so much the worse for women and children.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018How do you explain the bombardment of Antwerp by Zeppelins?\\u2019 I\\nqueried.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The Zeppelins have orders to drop their bombs only on fortifications\\nand soldiers,\\u2019 he answered.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018As a matter of fact,\\u2019 I remarked, \\u2018they destroyed only private houses\\nand innocent civilians, several of them women. If one of those bombs had\\ndropped 200 yards nearer my hotel I wouldn\\u2019t be smoking one of your\\nexcellent cigars to-day.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018That is a calamity which, thank God, didn\\u2019t happen,\\u2019 he replied.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018If you feel for my safety as deeply as that, General,\\u2019 I said\\nearnestly, \\u2018you can make quite sure of my coming to no harm by sending\\nno more Zeppelins.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Well, Herr Powell,\\u2019 said he, laughing, \\u2018we will think about it, and,\\u2019\\nhe continued gravely, \\u2018I trust that you will tell the American people\\nthrough your great paper what I have told you to-day. Let them hear our\\nside of this atrocity business. It is only justice that they should be\\nmade familiar with both sides of the question.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cI have quoted my conversation with General von Boehn as nearly verbatim\\nas I can remember it. I have no comments to make.\\n\\n\\u201cI will leave it to the readers of the _World_ to decide for themselves\\njust how convincing are the answers of the German General to the Belgian\\naccusations.\\u201d\\n\\n     \\u201c=We cannot doubt their (the Belgian Commission) competency for the\\n     task entrusted to them; nor can we mistrust their good faith. And\\n     of what nature is the story which their report, item by item,\\n     unrolls? They recount a series of acts committed by the German\\n     soldiery which, if even a half or a quarter be true, are enough to\\n     condemn them to everlasting shame as barbarians grosser and more\\n     criminal than Huns or Visigoths, or the hordes led by Yenghis Khan\\n     or Tamerlane the Great.=\\u201d\\n\\n        --From the _Daily Telegraph_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX.\\n\\nAtrocities Around Li\\xe9ge.\\n\\n\\nBelgian officials reported from Li\\xe9ge devilish atrocities committed in\\nthe town and suburbs. In the Place de l\\u2019Universit\\xe9, the Rue des\\nPitteurs, and the Quai des Pecheurs most of the houses were burned. The\\noccupants, who had been awakened by the acrid smoke, fled in terror, and\\nfifteen persons, men, women, and children, were killed as they ran,\\nwhile in one instance a family were called together, and father and son\\nwere killed and then mutilated in front of them. Apparently many of the\\nsoldiers breaking into _caf\\xe9s_ were drunk, and after firing accused the\\ninhabitants of it, taking vengeance by burning and murders without\\nrestraint. This indeed appeared to be part of the German campaign, for\\nnot only in Belgium, but also in France, the same inhuman and dastardly\\nexcuses were resorted to in order to attempt to justify the awful crimes\\nwhich these \\u201ccultured\\u201d barbarians committed.\\n\\n\\nRoad Strewn with Dead.\\n\\nGeorges Just, a restaurant-keeper at Chenee, province of Li\\xe9ge, said:\\n\\u201cWhen we heard of the German approach my wife and I fled across the\\nriver into Li\\xe9ge. It seems now like a dream. Just before they entered\\nthe town the Germans committed all kinds of outrages. Never shall I\\nforget the terrible sights along the roadside. Mutilated corpses of\\npeople I knew, and many wounded and dying, lay strewn in our path. In\\nsome places we saw the dead piled in heaps fifteen feet high.\\u201d\\n\\nA letter written by a niece of Mr. John Redmond, M.P., who was living in\\na Belgian town occupied by the Germans, contained the following:--\\n\\n\\u201cThey are absolute barbarians, and treat the women like dogs. For the\\nleast thing the inhabitants are shot, and they all live in fear of their\\nlives. The town\\u2019s most prominent men, in relays of three, guarded by\\nsoldiers, guarantee with their lives the good behaviour of the people.\\nMy husband is one of the guarantors. On Wednesday night he spent his\\nhours of vigil in the town hall. Imagine my feelings.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Germans take everything. No matter how well they are treated and\\nreceived, they behave filthily and brutally, officers and men alike.\\nEmpty houses they smash from top to bottom.\\u201d\\n\\n     \\u201c=The Belgian people are enduring the horrors of war, and after\\n     making every allowance for the source from which our information\\n     comes, we do not doubt that they are enduring them in a form which\\n     ought to be impossible amongst civilized nations.=\\u201d--_Bonar Law._\\n\\n\\nWhat an Eye-Witness Saw.\\n\\nAnother eye-witness was Mr. Henry Frenkel, a Russian living in Antwerp,\\nwho volunteered in the 6th regiment of the line to serve with his\\nBelgian friends. While the Germans were in Li\\xe9ge he was sent there upon\\nan important mission. This is how he tells his story:--\\n\\n\\u201cI got into Li\\xe9ge by Holland. I went first to Rosendael, then to\\nMaastricht, last to Eysden, and then openly passed the frontier. I will\\nnot describe Vis\\xe9, Mouland, Berneau, and other places, all burned,\\nsacked, and devastated in the most horrible fashion. Although all I have\\nseen has hardened my nerve, I still shiver when I think of it. One\\ncannot grasp the idea of all that has really taken place there. The\\nGermans, mad with rage on account of the resistance which we opposed to\\nthem, have acted like wild beasts, to give it a mild name. I have seen\\nmen, women, and children hanged or horribly mutilated. I have seen heaps\\nof corpses, of which no trace will be left in a few hours, as the\\ninhabitants round Li\\xe9ge have been commandeered to bury them in lots. Ah!\\nthe Prussians will have to render us a terrible account. I witnessed an\\nincident on the Place Lambert, in Li\\xe9ge. A Belgian chauffeur was arguing\\nwith a German officer. Visibly, the Belgian chauffeur could not\\nunderstand what was wanted of him. The crowd gathered, and I could not\\nfollow the rest of the scene; but I heard a revolver shot. Then German\\nsoldiers rushed out of the palace to stop the crowds, and I saw the\\nchauffeur, with blood-covered face, carried into a house by two\\nsoldiers. Not a sign of revolt from the crowd. The rifles are loaded,\\nready to go off. At my side a German said, laughingly: \\u2018Ach, das ist\\nnichts! Eine kleinigkeit.\\u2019 (\\u2018Oh! that\\u2019s nothing. Only a small thing.\\u2019)\\u201d\\n\\n\\nDinant Destroyed.\\n\\nIt was at Dinant, one of the most famous beauty spots of Belgium, and\\nwhich is so well known to English tourists, who flock to it in great\\nnumbers every year, that some particularly atrocious outrages took\\nplace. According to the message of Reuter\\u2019s correspondent at Ostend, the\\nwomen were confined in convents whilst hundreds of men were shot. A\\nhundred prominent citizens were shot in the Place d\\u2019Armes. M. Hummers,\\nmanager of a large weaving factory employing two thousand men, and M.\\nPoncelet, son of a former Senator, were both shot, the latter in the\\npresence of his six children. The Germans appeared at the branch of the\\nNational Bank, where they demanded all the cash in the safe. When the\\nmanager refused to give them the money they tried to blow the safe open.\\nNot succeeding in this they demanded the combination for the lock. The\\nmanager refused. On this the Germans shot him immediately, together with\\nhis two sons. Dinant was afterwards destroyed by shell-fire and\\nincendiarism.\\n\\n     \\u201c=The modern Attila respects neither the laws of nations nor the\\n     laws of God. His evil deeds cry aloud to Heaven and to the\\n     horror-struck watching nations.=\\u201d--_Times._\\n\\nThe wanton destruction of this ancient and beautiful town is a crime\\nsecond only to that committed at Louvain.\\n\\n\\nChildren Outraged.\\n\\nA Belgian soldier who fought at Dinant was eye-witness of a terrible\\nscene. Several German infantrymen had entered a house in a small village\\non the Meuse, and he, with four other Belgians, lay in wait for them.\\nThe Germans emerged with a young woman, whom they subjected to brutal\\nill-usage. The Belgians feared that if they fired they might hit the\\nwoman, but presently one of the Kaiser\\u2019s savages drew his bayonet and\\nplunged it into the poor girl\\u2019s breast, whereupon she sank down uttering\\na piteous cry.\\n\\nAt Harseet the Uhlans suddenly descended upon the village, shot the\\nfirst men they came across, numbering seven; this was followed by\\noutrages on women, and twenty-two men were carried off as prisoners. Two\\nUhlans demanded a fowl from a peasant, who replied that he had none.\\nThey found one, and promptly shot him.\\n\\nBecause two Jesuit professors at Louvain University were found with\\nnewspapers upon them, telling of German atrocities, one was shot, while\\nthirty of the Jesuits were taken away in carts to an unknown fate.\\n\\nIn La Pr\\xe9ville a number of Uhlans who broke open a _caf\\xe9_ and satiated\\nthemselves with drink saw a little boy of seven playing with a toy gun.\\nBecause he pointed it at a German soldier he was shot.\\n\\n\\nBase Act of Ingratitude.\\n\\nMany Belgian refugees, after weary wanderings, found themselves in\\nParis, and some of them were given shelter in the vast Cirque de Paris,\\nwhere straw was laid upon the floor upon which those made homeless and\\ndestitute by the Kaiser\\u2019s savage barbarians made their bed.\\n\\nOne old grey-haired man, bent and travel-stained, was found by a\\ncorrespondent seated alone and silently weeping. A kindly Red Cross\\nnurse inquired the reason of his despondency. He said: \\u201cMy name is Jean\\nBeauzon. I kept a little coffee-house just across the river from Li\\xe9ge,\\nin the town of Grivegnee. When the army was mobilized my two sons, both\\nstrapping fine fellows, went off to join the regiment. I have two\\ndaughters, one left with my old father and the other here\\u201d; so saying he\\npointed to a bright-eyed girl of sixteen, whose face and head were\\nswathed in bandages.\\n\\n\\u201cYou see,\\u201d he went on, \\u201cthat poor dear face. Well, a German did that.\\nThey burst into my place and demanded wine, which I gave them. What\\nhappened then I cannot exactly remember. It all seems like a horrible\\nnightmare. We subsequently left our home and wandered away in the\\nopposite direction from the terrible cannonading that was going on.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter walking in the dark for two hours my other daughter became too\\ntired to go any farther and sat down in despair by the roadside.\\n\\n\\u201cThis girl here and I then went on to try to find some means of\\nconveyance for her. A little way down the road we came upon a riderless\\nhorse, which we managed with great difficulty to catch and mount. We\\nthen went back to find my other daughter. We had not left her for more\\nthan half an hour, but she was no longer there. We spent the rest of the\\nnight looking for her, but found no sign or trace of her, and in the end\\nwere obliged to give up the search.\\n\\n\\u201cFinally we got into a train, which brought us here. I was cared for by\\nthe Red Cross.

With its buildings, its pictures, its unique library,\\nits unrivalled associations, a shameless holocaust of irreparable\\ntreasures lit up by blind barbarian vengeance.=\\u201d\\n\\nThis ancient city, the Oxford of Belgium, has been reduced by the new\\nHuns to a heap of ashes. \\u201cEvery traveller in Belgium,\\u201d says Sir William\\nRobertson Nicoll, \\u201cwill remember the ancient medi\\xe6val town, its\\nwonderful Hotel de Ville, the most perfect piece of architecture in\\nBelgium, the Church of St. Peter, begun in 1425, and the University with\\nits priceless library. All have perished, and why? The civil population\\nhad been disarmed, but in a night skirmish German soldiers accidentally\\nfired on their own guard, and it was decided in the panic of the hour to\\ndestroy the whole town. A town of forty-five thousand inhabitants, the\\nintellectual metropolis of the Low Countries since the fifteenth\\ncentury, is now no more than a heap of ashes.\\u201d\\n\\nThe wanton destruction of this ancient seat of learning, rich in\\nhistoric associations, was an act of vandalism almost without parallel\\nin history, a crime not only against humanity, but against the\\ngenerations of future years.\\n\\nThe restrained and dignified words in which our own Official Press\\nBureau made known the ruthless sacking of Louvain constitute a fearful\\nindictment of German Militarism, which can give official sanction to\\nsuch an appalling deed. Here are the words of the Press Bureau:--\\n\\n\\u201cAncient and beautiful Louvain, a town of forty-five thousand people, a\\nseat of learning, famous for its ancient and beautiful churches and\\nother buildings, many of them dating from the fifteenth century, has\\nbeen utterly destroyed by one of the Kaiser\\u2019s commanders in a moment of\\npassion to cover the blunder of his own men. The excuse for this\\nunpardonable act of barbarity and vandalism is that a discomfited band\\nof German troops returning to Louvain were fired upon by the people of\\nthe town, who had been disarmed a week earlier. The truth is that the\\nGermans, making for the town in disorder, were fired upon by their\\nfriends in occupation of Louvain, a mistake by no means rare in war. The\\nassumption of the German commander was, in the circumstances, so wide of\\nprobability that it can only be supposed that in the desire to conceal\\nthe facts the first idea which occurred to him was seized upon as an\\nexcuse for an act unparalleled in the history of civilized people.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Emperor William has stated that the only means of preventing\\nsurprise attacks from the civil population has been to interfere with\\nunrelenting severity and to create examples which, by their\\nfrightfulness, would be a warning to the whole country. The case of\\nLouvain is such an \\u2018interference,\\u2019 without even the miserable excuse\\nsuggested. Louvain is miles from the scene of real fighting. In\\nInternational Law it is recognized that \\u2018the only legitimate end which\\nthe States should aim at in war is the weakening of the military forces\\nof the enemy.\\u2019 And the rules under the annex to Convention IV. of 1907,\\nwhich expand and demand the provision of the Declaration of Brussels,\\nlay down that any destruction or seizure of enemies\\u2019 property, not\\nimperatively called for by military necessities, is forbidden.\\n\\n\\u201cIn destroying the ancient town of Louvain, the German troops have\\ncommitted a crime for which there can be no atonement, and Humanity has\\nsuffered a loss which can never be repaired.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nIncredible Wickedness.\\n\\nBut even the above statement does not relate one half of the fearful\\ncrimes against property and human life committed by these uniformed\\nruffians in the ill-fated city, perpetrated by hosts of armed men\\nagainst innocent and helpless non-combatants, aged men, defenceless\\nwomen, and children. The houses and buildings of the town were without\\ndoubt deliberately set on fire. Helped by petrol poured on by brutal\\nTeuton soldiers, the flames spread rapidly and fiercely.\\n\\n     \\u201c=For every vile deed wrought under the impious benedictions of the\\n     monarch who is ravaging Europe ample reparation shall be\\n     exacted.=\\u201d--_Times._\\n\\nEveryone who offered opposition was killed; everyone found in the\\npossession of arms shot. Wives saw their husbands murdered before their\\neyes, mothers their sons. Men were brutally dragged away from their\\nweeping wives and children, propped up against a wall and shot, or\\nruthlessly cut down where they stood. German soldiers, encouraged by\\ntheir officers, looted where and how they liked; the inhabitants were in\\nsome cases driven to take refuge on the roofs of their houses, which\\nwere set on fire. From burning houses were to be heard the agonized\\ncries of those perishing in the conflagration, which was destined to\\nreduce the city to ashes.\\n\\nMany authenticated stories of these terrible happenings have reached\\nLondon. At first they seemed unbelievable, but each day brings further\\ncorroboration. I take the liberty of reproducing a despatch of Mr. Hugh\\nMartin, the special correspondent of the _Daily News and Leader_, whose\\nvivid narrative brings home to us the details of the sufferings of the\\npoor victims of these abominable proceedings:--\\n\\n\\u201cStories of the sacking of Louvain, which are almost unbelievable in\\ntheir horror, reach here (Rotterdam) from the frontier. One of the most\\nvivid is that of an assistant in a bicycle shop, who, though a Dutchman,\\nwas given special facilities for escape owing to his being mistaken for\\na German.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018At mid-day last Tuesday,\\u2019 he begins, \\u2018a fearful uproar broke out in\\nthe streets while we were at dinner, and the crackle of musketry was\\nsoon followed by the roar of artillery near at hand.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Hearing shrieks from the inhabitants of our streets, I rushed to the\\nwindow and saw that several houses were already in flames. Soldiers were\\nsmashing the shop windows and looting in all directions.\\n\\n\\nShot Down Like Rabbits.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018As the people rushed into the streets from the burning houses they\\nwere shot down like rabbits. With my governor, his wife, and little boy,\\nwe fled to the cellar, where I and the boy hid under a pile of tyres,\\nwhile the manager crept into a chest, and his wife far into a drain,\\nwhere she stood with water up to her waist for many hours.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Night fell and the sound of shooting in the streets became brisker. I\\ncrept out of my hiding-place to get some water, and, peeping out of the\\nwindow, saw, to my horror, that almost the whole street was in ruins.\\nThen we found that our own house was alight, and it was necessary to\\nchoose between bolting and being burnt to death where we were.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018I decided to make a dash for it, but the moment I was outside the door\\nthree Germans held me up with their revolvers and asked me where I was\\ngoing. My reply was that I was a German, and that my master and his wife\\nwere Germans who had been trapped in the burning house.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Apparently my German was good enough to make them believe my\\nstatement, for they promised to give us safe conduct out of the town.\\nOur walk through the streets to the railway station I shall always\\nremember as a walk through hell.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The beautiful town, with its noble buildings, was a sea of flame. Dead\\nbodies lay thick in the streets. Dreadful cries came from many of the\\nhouses. It was half-past five on Wednesday morning when we reached the\\nrailway station. Soldiers were even then still going about the streets\\nwith lighted brands and explosives in their hands, setting alight any\\nbuildings that still remained intact.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018In the parks they had already begun to bury the dead, but in many\\ncases so shallow were the graves that a large part of each body was\\nstill visible. At the railway station we witnessed a truly harrowing\\nspectacle. Fifty citizens, both men and women, had been brought from\\nhouses from which the soldiers swore that shots had been fired.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018They were lined up in the street, protesting with tears in their eyes\\nthat they were innocent. Then came a firing squad. Volley followed\\nvolley, and the fifty fell dead where they stood.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cThis appalling story is fully confirmed by an independent despatch from\\na Dutch journalist who happened to be at Louvain on his way to Brussels.\\nHe states that he was standing on Tuesday evening near the railway\\nstation at Louvain talking to a German officer, when he was strongly\\nadvised to leave the spot, owing to the great danger.\\n\\n\\u201cA group of some five hundred men and women described as hostages were\\nranked in the open space by the station, and they were informed that for\\nevery soldier fired on in the town ten of them would be shot. This\\narrangement was carried out with true German regard for the punctilious\\nobservation of all rules.\\n\\n\\u201cThe wretched people sobbed and wrung their hands and fell on their\\nknees, but they might as well have appealed to men of stone.\\n\\n\\u201cTen by ten as the night wore on they were brought from the ranks and\\nslaughtered, without regard to age or sex, before the eyes of those who\\nremained.\\n\\n\\u201cAccounts differ widely as to the origin of the trouble, some declaring\\nthat the German patrols in the city fired on the German troops\\nretreating before a sortie from Antwerp, while others state that stray\\nshots were fired at a commissariat train passing through the town.\\n\\n\\u201cI would draw special attention to the fact that so far as the main\\nfacts are concerned both my informants are Dutchmen, who can have no\\nobject in spreading anti-German lies.\\u201d\\n\\nFurther terrible details are supplied by a cigar manufacturer who\\nhappened to be in Louvain about that time. Taken prisoner, he was\\nescorted by German soldiers from the town, which was then one mass of\\nflames, to the neighbouring village of Campenhout, where they witnessed\\nthe shooting of seven priests.\\n\\n\\u201cAltogether we were seventy-three men, handcuffed like criminals,\\u201d he\\nsays, \\u201cand we were locked in the church, and had to lie on the cold\\nfloor. Fresh prisoners arrived at intervals. Outside we could hear the\\ncries and lamentations of women and children. Inside an imprisoned\\npriest gave us absolution.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we left the church, Campenhout was burning fiercely. We were told\\nwe should be freed, but must return to Louvain. On returning, we were\\nonce more taken prisoners and driven in front of German soldiers across\\ncountry without rest or food, and used as a cover for the troops.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe \\u201cBlack Hole\\u201d Outdone.\\n\\nIncredible inhuman treatment was accorded to some twelve hundred people\\nwho were captured by the German barbarians in the act of fleeing from\\nthe doomed city. The men were separated from the women and children, and\\nmarched back to Louvain. Then began for them a terrible journey--a\\njourney that drove many mad and others to self-destruction.\\n\\n\\u201cLike so many brutes,\\u201d says the _Times_ correspondent, \\u201cthese burgesses\\nof Louvain, among them merchants, brewers, advocates, engineers, and\\nrepresentatives of all social grades, were herded into wagons which had\\nserved for the transport of horses and were inches deep in filth. Into\\neach wagon ninety men were crushed at the point of the bayonet by\\nsoldiers who seemed to glory in the maltreatment of their fellow-men.\\nThe unhappy prisoners had, of course, to stand, and to add to the\\nhorrors of the fetid atmosphere, the doors were shut, and only fugitive\\nrays of light filtered through the chinks.\\n\\n\\u201cFor two hours they were kept like this at Louvain station, after which\\nthe train left for Cologne. The journey occupied about fifty hours, and\\nthe Belgians during this awful time were given neither food nor drink.\\n\\u2018After such an experience,\\u2019 states one of them, \\u2018hell itself can have no\\nterrors.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cOnce strong physically and prosperous, he who spoke is now a nervous\\nwreck and destitute, living on the charity of friends who do not know\\nbut what it may be their turn to-morrow.\\n\\n\\u201cArrived at Cologne, the prisoners were marched through jeering crowds\\nto the Exhibition Gardens. Men and women surged round the pitiful band,\\nhurling at them vile epithets, and shouting, \\u2018Zum Tod, zum Tod!\\u2019 (\\u2018Kill\\nthem, kill them!\\u2019) Even the children joined in kicking the prisoners as\\nthey passed. The Belgians could gather no idea as to why they had been\\ndragged off to Germany, and even feared the worst. The night was passed\\nin the open, and in the morning they broke their prolonged fast on a\\nsmall portion of black bread.\\n\\n\\u201cSuddenly the German authorities changed their minds. Back the prisoners\\nmust go to Belgium, and, four abreast, the motley column regained the\\nstation. A passenger train awaited them, but each compartment for nine\\npeople was made to hold eighteen or nineteen. In some ways the home\\njourney was more terrible than the outward. For two days and three\\nnights the unfortunate inhabitants of Louvain were jolted about between\\nCologne and the capital of their own country, again absolutely without\\nfood.\\n\\n\\u201cOn rare occasions the guard exhibited a glimmering of pity, and\\npermitted the prisoners a mouthful of water. At the Gare du Nord, in\\nBrussels, compatriots smuggled food through the windows. The train only\\nstopped a short time here, and was off again to Schaerbeek.\\n\\n\\u201cCompletely at a loss what to do with their charges, the Prussian\\nofficers ordered them out of the train, and under an armed guard\\nmarched them on foot through Vilvorde and Pont Brul\\xe9 and on to Malines.\\nWhen crossing the fields the prisoners tore up turnips and beetroots and\\nate them ravenously. At Malines the officer in charge of the escort told\\nthe half-dead men they were free, and by different routes they reached\\nGhent, Bruges, Ostend, and other places in territory unoccupied by the\\nenemy.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe Massacre of Innocents.\\n\\nThe stories of the poor panic-stricken women of Louvain who emerged\\nalive from the night of terror cannot fail to arouse horror. One woman\\nupon whose face were marks of the intense suffering through which she\\nhad passed told how she tore down the curtains from her windows, wrapped\\nthem round some wearing apparel, and ran from the house with her two\\nchildren. In the street she became involved in a stampede of men, women,\\nand children rushing away from their burning town, whither she knew not.\\n\\nThis miserable refugee\\u2019s story was so disjointed, so interspersed with\\nhysterical sobs and exclamations, that it is impossible to make a full\\nand coherent narrative of it.\\n\\n\\u201cAh!\\u201d she exclaimed, with a convulsive shudder, \\u201cI will tell you of the\\nburning of Louvain. We had pulled down some of the buildings so that the\\nGermans should not mount guns on them when they came. I believe that was\\nthe reason. We were in a state of terror, because we had heard of the\\ncruelties of the Germans. But all we had heard of them was not so bad as\\nwe experienced. In the streets people were cruelly butchered, and then\\non all sides flames began to rise. We were prepared for what we regarded\\nas the worst, but never had we anticipated that they would burn us in\\nour homes. People rushed about frantic to save their property. They were\\nshot down by rifle volleys, struck down by sabres, and pierced by\\nlances. My God! What have we not suffered?\\u201d\\n\\nTwo young Oxford undergraduates who were present tell a graphic story,\\nin a letter to the _Times_, of the sack of the town and the burning of\\nthe neighbouring village. Leaving Aix-la-Chapelle on the Wednesday in\\nquestion, they set off for Louvain. As they passed through the little\\nhamlet of Cortenbergh they encountered a body of German troops who had\\nbeen dispatched to destroy the village. Taken prisoners, they were\\nguarded while the inhuman soldiers of the Kaiser made use of the\\ncartloads of straw which they had brought with them for their terrible\\npurpose. Soon every house was a mass of flames.\\n\\n\\u201cThis was in the afternoon,\\u201d they relate, \\u201cand from three to six o\\u2019clock\\nwe had to stand at the end of the street while the firing went on. It\\nwas a terrible spectacle, and our first glimpse of the horrors of war,\\nfor we saw five civilians, as they left their burning homes, ruthlessly\\nshot down by German soldiers. Neither of us will ever forget the\\nspectacle Louvain presented when we reached it the following morning.\\nThe whole town had apparently capitulated to the Germans, although\\noccasionally we heard the sound of firing. The greater part of the town\\nwas in flames. Houses were falling, telegraph and telephone poles were\\ntumbling into the streets, and the picture of desolation was complete,\\nwhile German soldiers were looting among the ruins. Dead bodies littered\\nthe streets.... Some German soldiers told us that they had taken four\\nhundred English prisoners from among those who had attacked their\\ntroop-trains, and three hundred and thirty of them had been shot that\\nmorning because they were found in possession of dum-dum bullets.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nA Refugee\\u2019s Plight.\\n\\nThe pathetic tale of a Belgian woman, who reached a place of safety\\nafter almost inconceivable hardship, was told in words which were few,\\nbut pregnant with tragedy and suffering. \\u201cPanic-stricken, we women fled\\nfrom the burning town, and, half-running and half-walking, hurried from\\nthe dreadful scene. Mile after mile we covered, until our feet seemed as\\nlead and our senses reeled. I am told we walked over seventy miles\\nbefore we came to a railway. I wanted to bow down and kiss the cold iron\\nrails. I fell exhausted, having carried my two children in turn.\\nFootsore, broken-hearted, after the first joy of sighting the railway, I\\nfelt my head whirling, and I wondered whether it was all worth while.\\nThen I thought of my deliverance, and thanked God.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat did Louvain look like? Like what it was--a mass of flame devouring\\nour homes, our property, and our relatives. Most of us women were\\ndeprived of our husbands. In the town everybody who offered any\\nopposition was killed, and everyone found to be armed in any way was\\nshot. Wives saw their husbands shot in the streets. I myself saw the\\nBurgomaster shot, and I saw another man dragged roughly away from his\\nweeping wife and children and shot through the head.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nAn American\\u2019s Story.\\n\\nA vivid word-picture of the scene is given by Mr. Gerald Morgan, an\\nAmerican, in the _Daily Telegraph_. \\u201cAn hour before sunset we entered\\nLouvain,\\u201d he says, \\u201cand found the city a smoking furnace. The railway\\nstation was crowded with troops, drunk with loot and liquor, and rapine\\nas well. From house to house, acting under orders, groups of soldiers\\nwere carrying lighted straw, placing it in the basement, and then\\npassing on to the next. It was not one\\u2019s idea of a general\\nconflagration, for each house burned separately--hundreds of individual\\nbonfires--while the sparks shot up like thousands of shooting stars into\\nthe still night-air. It was exactly like a display of fireworks or\\nBengal lights and set-pieces at a grand display in Coney Island.\\n\\n\\u201cMeanwhile, through the station arch we saw German justice being\\nadministered. In a square outside, where the cabs stand, an officer\\nstood, and the soldiers drove the citizens of Louvain into his presence,\\nlike so many\\n\\n[Illustration: WRECKAGE IN THE STUDENTS\\u2019 QUARTER OF LOUVAIN.\\n\\n_Photo, Newspaper Illustrations, Ld._\\n\\n_Face p. 87._]\\n\\nunwilling cattle on a market day. Some of the men, after a few words\\nbetween the officer and the escorts, were marched off under fixed\\nbayonets behind the railway station. Then we heard volleys, and the\\nsoldiers returned. Then the train moved out, and the last we saw of the\\ndoomed city was an immense red glare in the gathering darkness.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nWhat M. Carton de Wiart Told Me.\\n\\nBefore leaving the subject of Louvain it is necessary for me to\\nchronicle the following, which was told me by M. Carton de Wiart, the\\nBelgian Minister of Justice. \\u201cAs to the sacking of Louvain,\\u201d he stated,\\n\\u201cwe have here a statement dated August 30th, which has been handed to\\nthe Commission by a person of universal repute in Belgium, and which has\\nbeen telegraphed to us. On August 30th that person went from Brussels to\\nLouvain. On the high-road, when he got to a place called Weerde St.\\nGeorge, he saw only burning villages and peasants beside themselves with\\nterror. When he reached Louvain and got to the American College--a large\\nnumber of American students, young priests, and medical students come to\\nLouvain--he found that fire had destroyed the whole town except the town\\nhall and city station. This gentleman noted that on Sunday last the\\nGermans kept on kindling new fires and placing straw so as to carry the\\nfire farther. The cathedral and the theatre had been destroyed, and had\\ncollapsed completely. So had the famous library, one of the most\\nprecious in the world, especially as regards manuscripts and works of\\nart. The town,\\u201d he says, \\u201cpresents the aspect of an old ruined city, a\\ncity like Pompeii. In the midst of this scene of desolation the only\\npeople you could see were drunken soldiers carrying bottles of wine and\\nliqueurs in their arms, and officers themselves sitting in the streets\\naround tables drinking like their men.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe \\u201cTimes\\u201d Speaks Out.\\n\\nFinally I give a quotation from the _Times_:--\\n\\n\\u201cDeep and deadly must be the vengeance which the defenders of\\ncivilization will exact from these new apostles of brutality. Even\\nAttila had his better side. He spared Milan. It has been said of him\\nthat, though he destroyed cities without remorse, he respected the laws\\nof nations as they were understood in his day. The modern Attila\\nrespects neither the laws of nations nor the laws of God. His evil deeds\\ncry aloud to Heaven and to the horror-struck watching nations. The\\ninfamous crime of the destruction of Louvain is without a parallel even\\nin the dark ages. The harmless civil population had been disarmed a week\\nago. The German garrison at the gates of the town fired upon another\\nforce of their own countrymen. To conceal their blunder, they laid the\\nblame upon the helpless townspeople. No denials were listened to. Some\\nof the men of Louvain were shot, the rest were made prisoners, the women\\nand children were flung into trains and carried off to an unknown\\ndestination, and the city was razed to the ground. Louvain has ceased\\nto exist. A town of forty thousand inhabitants, bigger than Crewe or\\nDover or Colchester or Keighley, has been completely wiped out. The\\nwickedness of this abominable act shall be expiated to the uttermost\\nwhen the day of reckoning comes.\\n\\n\\u201cUntil now we have maintained an attitude of deliberate reserve upon the\\ninnumerable tales of German atrocities which have reached us. We\\npublished without comment the unanswerable list of shocking excesses\\ncommitted by the German troops, which was sent to England by the Belgian\\nauthorities. When a German Zeppelin cast bombs upon ill-fated women\\nasleep in their beds at Antwerp, we did no more than explain the\\nbearings of international law upon conduct which has met with universal\\nreprobation in Europe and America. But now the real object of German\\nsavagery is self-revealed, not only by the effacement of Louvain, but by\\nthe shameful admissions sent forth from the wireless station at Berlin.\\nLast Thursday night the following official notification regarding\\nBelgium came vibrating through the air:--\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The only means of preventing surprise attacks from the civil\\npopulation has been to interfere with unstinting severity and to create\\nexamples which by their frightfulness would be a warning to the whole\\ncountry.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cSuch is the cynical nature of the German apologia for the destruction\\nof Louvain. Such is the character of the warfare of the modern Huns.\\nThey seek to strike terror into the hearts of their foes by methods\\nwhich belong to the days of the old barbaric hosts, who were thought to\\nhave vanished from the world for ever. There must be no mistake about\\nthe opportionment of blame for this and numberless other crimes. We have\\nlistened too long to the bleatings of professors bemused by the false\\nglamour of a philosophy which the Germans themselves have thrust aside.\\n\\n\\u201c=The Kaiser and his people are alike responsible for the acts of their\\nGovernment and their troops, and there can be no differentiation when\\nthe day of reckoning comes. The Kaiser could stop these things with a\\nword. Instead, he pronounces impious benedictions upon them. Daily he\\nappeals for the blessings of God upon the dreadful deeds which are\\nstaining the face of Western Europe--the ravaged villages, the hapless\\nnon-combatants hanged or shot, the women and children torn from their\\nbeds by cowards and made to walk before them under threats of all the\\ninfamies which have eternally disgraced German \\u2018valour.\\u2019=\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII.\\n\\n     \\u201c=Just for a word--\\u2018neutrality\\u2019--just for a scrap of paper Great\\n     Britain was going to make war.=\\u201d--_The German Chancellor._\\n\\n     _The \\u201cscrap of paper\\u201d was the Powers\\u2019 treaty guaranteeing Belgium\\n     neutrality._\\n\\n\\nFrench Protest to the Powers.\\n\\nSo numerous and so terrible were the outrages committed by Germans on\\nFrench territory that the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, on\\nSeptember 2nd--a month after the outbreak of hostilities--was compelled\\nto address a communication to the Powers which set forth a large number\\nof authenticated cases of barbarity. In the course of this official\\nstatement it was explained that the indisputable facts set out were\\nselected merely as examples, and that it was impossible to bring to the\\nnotice of the Powers every act contrary to the laws of war of which\\naccounts were being received day by day. The series of memoranda were\\nsufficient to establish the two following classes of facts:--\\n\\n     \\u201cFirst. The Armies and Government of Germany profess the deepest\\n     scorn for International Law, and for treaties solemnly recognised\\n     for Germany.\\n\\n     \\u201cSecondly. The devastations of the invaded countries (incendiarism,\\n     murder, pillage, and atrocities) appear to be systematically\\n     pursued by order of the leaders, and are not due to acts of\\n     indiscipline.\\n\\n     \\u201cIt is necessary to emphasise this two-fold characteristic of the\\n     German proceedings. They constitute a negation of every human and\\n     International law, and bring back modern warfare, after centuries\\n     of civilisation, to the methods of barbaric invasions. We are\\n     confident that such facts will arouse the indignation of neutral\\n     States, and will help to make clear the meaning of the struggle\\n     which we are carrying on in the respect of law and independence of\\n     nations.\\u201d\\n\\nTo this _communiqu\\xe9_ were attached ten separate memoranda, setting forth\\nvarious specific charges against the Germans, and showing, among other\\nthings, how the Kaiser\\u2019s troops were killing the French wounded, and had\\neven shot Red Cross nurses.\\n\\n\\nA Dead Man\\u2019s Diary.\\n\\n\\u201cIn the fifth of these memoranda,\\u201d says Reuter\\u2019s correspondent, \\u201cthe\\nGerman allegation that the civilian population had taken part in the war\\nwas strongly denied, and was declared to be nothing but a pretext put\\nforward by the German troops to give them the appearance of reprisals.\\nFrom the beginning of the war the Germans had made a practice of burning\\nundefended villages and of assassinating the inhabitants, and evidence\\nof this was to be found in letters and notebooks which had been taken\\nfrom Germans, dead or prisoners.\\u201d\\n\\nA notebook found on a corpse of a German lieutenant contained the\\nfollowing remark:--\\u201cWe have fired the church of Villerupt and shot the\\ninhabitants. We pretended that scouts had taken refuge in the tower of\\nthe church and had fired on us from there. The fact was, it was not the\\ninhabitants of Villerupt, but Customs officers and forest guards who\\nfired on us.\\u201d\\n\\nThe sixth memorandum gave detailed evidence in support of the charge\\nthat a systematic devastation of the country had been ordered by the\\nGerman leaders. Letters found on German soldiers made it clear that the\\nburning of villages and the shooting of the inhabitants were general\\nmeasures, and that the orders were given by superior officers.\\n\\nAttention was called to this violation of The Hague Convention, and it\\nwas pointed out that it was on the proposal of the German delegates at\\nthe second Hague Conference that an article was inserted declaring that\\nthe belligerent guilty of such violation should be liable to pay an\\nindemnity.\\n\\nIn the remaining memoranda information was given as to the destruction\\nof villages in the region of Paris, and the burning of Affleville, under\\ncircumstances of particular brutality.\\n\\nThe statement concluded: \\u201cThe Government of the Republic, respecting\\nInternational conventions which it has ratified, protests against those\\nviolations of International law, and holds up to reprobation before the\\nopinion of the world the behaviour of an enemy who respects no rule and\\ngoes back on his signature affixed to International agreements.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe Red Hand of Destruction.\\n\\nUpon the Franco-German frontier the red hand of destruction was indeed\\nlaid heavily, and it seemed incredible that a civilised nation should\\nresort to the methods of savages. Yet it was, alas, true, as was proved\\nin hundreds of cases. Atrocities were committed everywhere; civilians,\\nwomen, and children were shot down in blind rage. A German officer\\ncaptured by the French near Blamont admitted that the Germans wanted no\\nprisoners, and that the wholesale massacre of peaceful villagers was\\naccording to orders.\\n\\nGerman infantrymen belonging to the Bavarian regiments systematically\\nset fire to the villages through which they passed in the region of\\nBarras, Harbone, and Montreux, for during the engagement no artillery\\nfire could have caused such conflagrations. In the same district they\\nforced the inhabitants to precede their scouts. According to the same\\nreport the German troops were daily massacring peaceful villagers, and\\nactually made children march before them when debouching from the\\nvillages upon the field of battle.\\n\\nAn official report was made by M. Mirman, Prefect of the Meurthe and\\nMoselle, to the French Minister of the Interior, after a visit paid to\\nthe districts of Bardonviller, Cirey, and Blamont, in the Luneville\\narea. He stated that it was impossible to cite all the acts of savagery\\nand brutality on the part of the German troops which had come under his\\nnotice. He could make out a long list of women, young girls, and old men\\nand women who had been executed without the least reason and upon the\\nslightest pretext. Houses had been systematically burned by order of the\\nGerman officers as they advanced, and then again as they retreated.\\n\\n\\nPetrol on Burning Houses.\\n\\nAt Bardonviller, where one of the Kaiser\\u2019s sons was with the troops,\\neleven of the inhabitants had been murdered, among whom was the wife of\\nthe mayor, and a woman with her infant child, while seventy-eight houses\\nwere burned with petrol and specially-prepared faggots. After pillaging\\nthe town and looting everything they could, they fired on and demolished\\nthe church, and took fifteen of the inhabitants, including a magistrate,\\naway as hostages.\\n\\nAt Bremeuil the Prefect found a pitiful and shameful state of affairs.\\nThere, five inhabitants, one a little lad, were butchered, as well as an\\nold man of seventy-four, who was \\u201ctrussed and shot like a rabbit.\\u201d The\\nCommunal building was destroyed, and nearly the whole town swept away,\\nnot during battle, but by the soldiers on their arrival.\\n\\nThe French troops in Lorraine had seized an entire mail, letters written\\nby German soldiers to their families. In these it was shown that the\\nchief occupation of the troops was eating and drinking, and in more than\\ntwenty of the letters it was stated that all French civilians were shot\\nif they only looked suspicious or evil-disposed. All the men, and even\\nboys under age, were shot.\\n\\nAnother official statement issued by the French Ministry of War stated\\nthat two Uhlans who were reconnoitring on the frontier entered the\\nlittle village of Affleville. They were ejected by a patrol of three\\nmounted riflemen. On the following day a detachment of Uhlans returned,\\nset fire to a farmhouse, and killed the farmer, who attempted to save\\nhis property. The inhabitants protested that their village had not\\ninterfered with the enemy, but later that evening a further squadron of\\nUhlans arrived while all the villagers were attending service in the\\nchurch, and after sprinkling the houses with petroleum set the whole\\nplace on fire. The terrified inhabitants fled without money or other\\nproperty to Verdun, the parish priest being shot.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWe Kill Everyone.\\u201d\\n\\nMany other sensational indictments of the blood-lust of the Kaiser\\u2019s\\nsavage hordes reached the French Ministry of Justice. The Cur\\xe9 of\\nPillon, in the Metz district, states that on August 10th fifteen Germans\\nentered his house and pointed their rifles at him. He was dragged into\\nthe road and brought before the General. On the way there he was\\nhurried along with the butts of his captors\\u2019 rifles. When he stopped\\nthey hit him. He took out his handkerchief, and they confiscated it. He\\nshouted: \\u201cYou are a set of brutes. Take me before one of your officers\\nwho speaks French.\\u201d An officer replied in French, \\u201cIt\\u2019s all up with\\nyou.\\u201d A French shell burst not far from the German troops. The Germans\\nthrew themselves down, but compelled the priest to remain standing.\\n\\nSeven lads from French Lorraine at Baroncourt saw a body of Uhlans\\ndriving before them old men, women, and children. They struck those that\\nwould not or could not walk. Three Uhlans moved aside to a field where a\\nboy of fifteen was tending a herd of cows. The youth attempted to\\nprevent the seizure of the cattle. The troopers shot him point-blank,\\nand he fell without a cry.\\n\\nIn Lorraine a large number of letters written by German soldiers were\\ncaptured, and these letters are full of descriptions of acts of wanton\\ncruelty. Most of the writers make reference to food and drink. One says,\\n\\u201cWe have no need for money. We simply take.\\u201d In another it is written,\\n\\u201cBefore burning the village we took away everything that was eatable or\\ndrinkable,\\u201d and again, \\u201cThe first village across the frontier was\\ncompletely destroyed. It was a sight which was both sad and agreeable.\\u201d\\nIn another letter it is stated, \\u201cWe have shot the inhabitants of from\\nfourteen to sixty years old. There were thirty of them.\\u201d In twenty other\\nletters the phrases recur, \\u201cAll were shot. We kill everyone.\\u201d\\n\\n     \\u201c=The efforts directed towards the abolition of war must not only be\\n     termed foolish, but absolutely immoral, and must be described as\\n     unworthy of the human race.=\\u201d--_Gen. Von Bernhardi._\\n\\n\\nVillage Ruthlessly Bombarded.\\n\\nRefugees from Lorraine had a pathetic story to tell. The village of\\nPontsurseille was burned on August 21st by the Germans. Like several\\nothers in the neighbourhood, it was close to the border-line, and\\ncourteous relations continued between its inhabitants and the enemy,\\neven after the first days of the war. But on August 14th a body of\\nUhlans suddenly appeared and commandeered a number of things. They were\\nsupplied at once with 200 chickens, a quantity of oats, and some other\\nprovisions. The Guard Champ\\xeatre himself delivered the objects\\ncommandeered, and took them across the border into the German camp. He\\nwas not allowed to return immediately, and was detained for two days. On\\nMonday, August 17th, when the Guard Champ\\xeatre had returned, a shell\\nsuddenly burst over the village. It exploded a few yards from a place\\nwhere a couple of women were engaged in milking the cows. Other shells\\nfollowed. They came from a battery erected on the other side of the\\nborder.\\n\\nNo French soldier had been seen at the village for three days. They had\\nmade their appearance only for a short time, and had fallen back. The\\nfiring stopped after a while, but was resumed during the night and\\ncontinued for several nights following. All the able-bodied men had left\\nfor the garrisons, and only the women, the children, and some aged men\\nremained. The Guard Champ\\xeatre was the only person with any authority\\nthat remained, and he took over the administration of the commune.\\nMeanwhile he was compelled every day to go back and forwards between the\\nvillage and the German camp and supply the provisions that were\\ncommandeered.\\n\\nA young seminarist acted as secretary at the Mairie, and the wife of the\\nGuard Champ\\xeatre took charge of the fire-engine and tried to put out the\\nfire caused by the shells with the help of some other women.\\n\\nOn the night of August 20th it became evident that the Germans intended\\nto lay the village in ruins. The bombardment was continued all night and\\nthe following day. The inhabitants took refuge in the cellars, which\\nprotected them against the shells. About forty of them found shelter in\\na big cellar belonging to a rich farmer, M. Fran\\xe7ois Michel.\\n\\n\\nHelpless Children.\\n\\nThere were small children of three, six, and nine years, and infants\\nonly a few months old. The Guard Champ\\xeatre, assisted by his wife,\\ndirected everything. He had the openings protected by mattresses, which\\nprevented the Germans from discharging their rifles into the cellar.\\n\\nBy making a hole in one of the walls he secured a retreat into an\\nadjoining cellar. Suddenly an officer came, had the door opened, and\\nordered everybody to come out at once. M. Fran\\xe7ois Michel was the first\\nto step out, and he was instantly shot down by a group of soldiers\\nstanding by. Next a boy of six, a nice little lad, stepped out. He was\\nalso shot down. Everybody in the cellar then rushed back, amid cries of\\nhorror raised by the wife of M. Michel and his children.\\n\\nThe Germans shouted, \\u201cCome out, or we shall burn you alive,\\u201d and fired a\\nvolley down the steps of the cellar. The soldiers poured petroleum down\\nthe cellar and on the mattresses, and set fire to it. The people inside\\ntook refuge in the adjoining cellar, and the Guard Champ\\xeatre and his\\nwife were the last to leave. From this cellar they finally escaped and\\nfled across the field. The soldiers meanwhile had seized the young\\nseminarist, and another young man, aged twenty, and shot them, declaring\\nthat they were of age for military service.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE CHURCH AT TERMONDE IN RUINS.\\n\\n_Photo, Sport and General._\\n\\n_Face p. 101_]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII.\\n\\nThe Desecration of Churches.\\n\\n\\nOther refugees from Lorraine had harrowing stories to tell of German\\nbrutalities, and many made statements which were officially registered.\\nWhole villages, they said, had been put to fire and sword. One man told\\nan official of the Catholic Society that he had, with his own eyes, seen\\ntwo German soldiers chop off the arms of a child which clung to its\\nmother\\u2019s skirts. Other narratives show once more that the Germans\\nentered closed houses and shot or bayoneted the inmates on the pretence\\nthat they had been fired upon by them. Miners had in many places been\\nwilfully entombed, and other miners had been forced to dig trenches for\\nthe enemy under the threat of being shot. Germans had stabled their\\nhorses in churches, which they desecrated, and even covered their\\nanimals with priests\\u2019 vestments.\\n\\nUnder their usual plea the Germans burned the town of Burzweiler, in\\nAlsace-Lorraine, blowing up its factories.\\n\\nAn eye-witness, M. Gaudefroy-Demonhynes, who was attempting to return to\\nFrance from Baden, made a sworn statement to a Paris magistrate,\\nexplaining how he had found himself on August 1st detained with other\\nFrenchmen and some Russians at the railway station of Lorrach, in Baden,\\na few miles from the French frontier. The party were arrested by\\nsoldiers and taken to the police station, where they and their luggage\\nwere searched. They were then led under guard through the town amid\\nhostile demonstrations by the inhabitants to the square in front of the\\nrailway station, where they found another party of about thirty\\nFrenchmen and twenty Russians.\\n\\nOne of this party, a French commercial traveller, a stout man aged about\\nforty, suddenly shouted \\u201cVive la France!\\u201d Instantly the two soldiers\\nguarding him took him before an officer or a non-commissioned officer,\\nstanding a few paces away from a group of officers. People standing\\nbetween M. Demonhynes and the scene prevented him from hearing what was\\nsaid, but a few seconds later a shot--only one shot--rang out.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know who fired,\\u201d the witness says, \\u201cbut I know that just before\\nthe report the Frenchman was standing before my eyes against the wall of\\na restaurant facing the station, held fast by his two guards in the\\nposition of one who is about to be executed.\\n\\n\\u201cHardly had the shot rang out than protests arose from our little band.\\nAmong those who protested most vigorously were three young Frenchmen\\nfrom eighteen to twenty years old. They looked to me like students\\nleaving Germany, like myself. I did not speak to them and do not know\\ntheir names. Just as the soldiers seized him and his comrades one of the\\nyoung Frenchmen tried to speak to an officer who was wearing a large,\\nlight grey cloak. This officer did not listen to him. Some order must\\nhave been given, I don\\u2019t know by whom.\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the three Frenchmen, who must have been told of the fate\\nawaiting him, cried out in German \\u2018Don\\u2019t hold us. We aren\\u2019t afraid; we\\nare Frenchmen!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cThis time the officer replied coarsely, half turning round, \\u2018Shut up.\\u2019\\nThe three Frenchmen of their own accord placed themselves against the\\nwall of the same restaurant. Two lines of soldiers were drawn up on\\neither side of them at right angles to the wall. Other soldiers--how\\nmany I did not count--took up their position in front of them about\\neight yards away. A volley rang out. The three Frenchmen fell.\\n\\n\\u201cFresh cries arose from our party. Horror-stricken women began to weep.\\nI did not see the bodies removed, but I saw them fall to the ground.\\n\\n\\u201cAt this moment a great uproar broke out. Another Frenchman, a big man\\nwith a great black beard, whose age and appearance I forget and whom I\\ndid not know, began to shout, \\u2018Cowards! Murderers!\\u2019 Soldiers surrounded\\nhim. He struggled with them. They speedily overcame him, and, without\\ntaking the trouble to stand him up against the wall, without the\\nintervention of any officer, one of the soldiers thrust the barrel of\\nhis rifle against his body and shot him down point blank before my eyes.\\n\\n\\u201cI saw these same soldiers dragging his body along the ground. The man\\nwas struggling still. I had not the strength to look any more. I heard\\nother shots. I don\\u2019t know if there were any other victims.\\u201d\\n\\nThe German troops allowed no considerations of religion or respect for\\nantiquity to interfere with their scheme of devastation. Great works of\\nart and architecture and ancient churches were destroyed by fire or\\nshell, and in more than one instance it is stated that cathedrals were\\nused for stabling horses. To-day many are the ruined churches in\\nBelgium. Of the beautiful cathedral of Louvain only the walls stand, for\\nthe interior is reported to have been ruthlessly shelled, pillaged, and\\nfinally set on fire. Other churches in the ill-fated city similarly\\nsuffered, while at Malines, too, bare walls and loose masonry are all\\nthat remain of what were until recently sacred edifices of exceptional\\ninterest to visitors by reason of their ancient treasures.\\n\\n     \\u201c=We believe that some of the generals and some of the officers have\\n     encouraged these crimes, which would be impossible without such\\n     countenance. Yet we trust that there are still German officers\\n     whose characters can be respected.=\\u201d\\n\\n        --From the _Morning Post_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV.\\n\\n     \\u201c=It is not a fair fight. Germany is fighting foully; she is defying\\n     not only the rules of war, but the rules of humanity.=\\u201d--_Mr.\\n     Richard Harding Davis_, the great American author.\\n\\n\\nTreatment of English Travellers.\\n\\nThe treatment meted out to English travellers and residents in Germany\\nat the time of the outbreak of the war was equally in keeping with the\\nmodern culture of the nation. British subjects arriving in England were\\nloud in their protest of the manner in which they were treated, and even\\nBritish, French, and Russian Consuls were treated like criminals. In\\nregard to the latter, a mock formality of presenting the Consuls with\\npassports was gone through before their departure, but, provided with\\nthese so-called guarantees of safe conduct, they were subjected to the\\ngrossest insults on the way, the women being the chief object of the\\nmob\\u2019s fury. Insulting inscriptions were scribbled on the walls of their\\ncompartments, and they were the objects of very hostile demonstrations.\\nAt every station brave soldiers of the Kaiser presented their revolvers\\nat the heads of the travellers, came up to the carriage windows, jeered\\nat the occupants, and often threw rubbish into the compartments.\\n\\nMr. Drummond Hay, the British Consul at Dantzig, the French Consul, M.\\nMichel, and the Russian Consul were, with their families, turned out\\nfrom their consulates at an hour\\u2019s notice. They were told that they\\nwould be taken to the Russian frontier, but in reality they were\\nconveyed to Bentheim, near the Dutch frontier, _via_ Stettin, a journey\\nwhich occupied three days. During the journey they were not given nor\\nallowed to buy any food, and when the train reached Bentheim the\\ntravellers were curtly told to get out, and the Consuls were immediately\\nseparated from their families. The women and children were housed in a\\nmean tavern under strict military guard, and the men, together with Mr.\\nDrummond Hay\\u2019s sixteen-year-old son, were taken to the local prison.\\nThey were all put into one small cell, which they found already tenanted\\nby M. Vassel, an attach\\xe9 of the French Consulate at Bentheim, who had\\nbeen imprisoned some days previously. M. Vassel had been arrested when\\nlooking after the luggage of the French Consul at Bentheim, who had just\\nleft for Holland.\\n\\nIn prison the Consuls were treated as though they belonged to the worst\\nclass of criminals. They were obliged to sleep on the floor, without\\ncovering of any kind, and with only a few wisps of straw between them\\nand the cold stones, and their only food was the black bread which is\\nserved out to the ordinary convicts.\\n\\nHaving fallen ill on the journey, M. Michel asked to be allowed to see a\\ndoctor, but, in lieu of medical advice, he was given a very strong dose\\nof castor oil, which made him very much worse. The conditions under\\nwhich these four men and a boy lived cannot be described. The gaolers\\nwould not allow them nor anyone else to clean out the cell. Night and\\nday the unfortunate prisoners were herded together. Their only\\nrecreation, a daily walk of half an hour\\u2019s duration, was taken in\\ncompany with the convicts.\\n\\nTen days after leaving Dantzig Mr. Drummond Hay was set free, but the\\nothers were detained amid the awful surroundings which have been\\ndescribed.\\n\\nIt was ascertained that there were forty-eight other foreigners--among\\nthem fifteen Frenchmen--who are being kept in the town of Bentheim under\\nthe strictest military observation.\\n\\nThe state of affairs in Dantzig when the Consuls left was terrible; many\\npeople were being shot daily, often upon the very scantiest suspicion.\\n\\nIf the Germans treated responsible Government officials in the manner\\ndescribed above, how much worse was the case of unfortunate girls and\\nwomen stranded alone in Germany. In many cases English governesses in\\nGerman families were cast adrift, to starve and endure the insults of\\nthe savage enemy. Hundreds of English men and women, many of them\\ntourists, were thrown into prison without any trial, and suffered the\\nsame indignities as did our Consul at Dantzig.\\n\\n\\nEnglishwoman\\u2019s Experience.\\n\\nA well-authenticated story was related by the headmistress of a London\\nelementary school, who was in Switzerland when the war broke out and who\\nreturned to England prostrate with shock at the horror of scenes she\\nwitnessed while passing through Germany. The train, she said, was\\npacked; all windows were closed, and the blinds drawn, and the\\npassengers were forbidden on peril of their lives to raise them.\\nGlimpses of troop trains were caught at intervals, and to allow these to\\npass frequent stops were made. The pace was slow, and the crowded,\\nunventilated carriages became unendurably close. In the same compartment\\nas the lady in question were two English women, whom she learned to be\\nteachers in the provinces. One of these became ill, and at last, when\\nthe train came to a stop at a countryside place between stations--there\\nwas no means of locating it--her friend helped the sick girl to alight\\nin order to breathe some fresh air. Instantly bullets hailed upon them,\\nand both were shot dead. Their travelling companions dared make no\\nattempt to recover the bodies, and when the train passed on they were\\nleft beside the line.\\n\\nTwo teachers of another London girls\\u2019 school state that a woman\\ntravelling with them through Germany was shot for failing to show her\\npassport, and her body thrown out upon the line. Other ladies in the\\nsame train stated that they had been stripped by German officers on the\\npretence of searching them.\\n\\n[Illustration: A MALINES RED-CROSS WARD WHICH WAS SHELLED BY THE\\nGERMANS.\\n\\n_Photo, Sport and General._\\n\\n_Face p. 109._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV.\\n\\n     \\u201c=France must be so completely crushed that she can never again come\\n     across our path.=\\u201d--_Gen. Von Bernhardi._ (This statement was made\\n     long before war was declared.)\\n\\n\\nWhat Our Soldiers Say.\\n\\nBy innumerable acts of treachery and appalling savagery on the\\nbattlefield the German soldiers have forfeited for ever the right to the\\ncourtesies usually extended to an honourable foe. The opening phases of\\nthe war have shown them in the light of cold-blooded barbarians, rather\\nthan honourable soldiers. The well-attested stories of their shocking\\nbrutality have no parallel in the history of the world. And in\\npractically every case these incredible acts of cruelty have been\\ncommitted with the knowledge and approval of their officers. They are\\ncarrying out to the letter the advice of the Kaiser to act like the Huns\\nof Attila.\\n\\nBritish soldiers who have returned wounded from the front are emphatic\\nin their assertions that the German gunners deliberately fired on the\\nhospitals and Red Cross men. One man remarked, \\u201cThey seemed to take a\\ndelight in aiming at hospitals, which had the Red Cross over them. In\\nfact, anything with the Red Cross acted as a target. A church was being\\nused as a hospital, and one of our officers, who had a flesh wound, was\\ntaken inside for medical attention. Whilst he was there a shell blew\\naway the roof of the church, and injured him a second time. Fifty men\\nwent out under the Red Cross to pick up wounded. They were fired on, and\\nonly two of them came back.\\u201d\\n\\nA member of the Red Cross organisation stated that the Germans have\\ntreated with actual brutality the British wounded who fell into their\\nhands. Twenty-seven British soldiers who were being removed from the\\nfield in an ambulance were dragged away and made to march to the Town\\nHall of Mons, two falling unconscious in the streets on their way.\\n\\nA resident of Ostend, in a letter to this country, put into words the\\nprevailing opinion in Belgium. \\u201cThese Germans are not true soldiers,\\u201d he\\nwrites, \\u201cthey are murderers in uniform. They kill the wounded and shoot\\nthe women and children. At one of the charges at Li\\xe9ge the Colonel of\\nthe 9th Regiment of the Line was shot through the head, and when his\\nbody was recovered later in the day it was found that these German\\ncowards had inflicted at least twenty bayonet stabs on the already dead\\nbody.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nHelpless Soldiers Maimed.\\n\\nThese terrible allegations are borne out by information which has been\\nreceived by a British officer from his son at the front, who states that\\nthe enemy, on coming across wounded British soldiers, proceed to stab\\nthem through the right hand with a bayonet, with a view to rendering the\\nhand useless for holding a rifle again.\\n\\nA horrible story is told by a wounded British sergeant. Struck down by a\\nbullet, he lay on his back on the battlefield of Mons, unable to move,\\naround him many wounded men. The German soldiers advanced over their\\nbodies, stabbing at them with their bayonets. Realising that his only\\nchance of saving his life was to feign death, the wounded \\u201cTommy\\u201d closed\\nhis eyes and kept perfectly still. As the Germans passed one struck him\\non the body a heavy blow with the butt of a rifle, with the result that\\none of his ribs was smashed. Clenching his teeth to prevent crying out\\nhe lay rigid, hoping against hope that the barbarous enemy would not see\\nthat he still lived. Then to his relief they passed on, but not before\\none of them had plunged his bayonet into his shoulder.\\n\\nSuch stories as these make one\\u2019s blood boil, but they are by no means\\nisolated instances. Many wounded soldiers who have returned have\\ndeclared that after the battle of Mons the Germans, especially officers\\nand non-commissioned officers, passed over the ground and thrust their\\nswords at the wounded men. One man escaped by hiding for twenty-four\\nhours under sheaves of corn.\\n\\nYet another story is told by a wounded soldier who was also in the\\nfighting near Mons. He said, \\u201cWe had had to retire a short distance,\\nleaving some killed and wounded behind. We saw the Germans come along.\\nThey carried away some of our men who were lying on the ground we had\\nleft. They placed them--and I am positively sure there were wounded as\\nwell as killed among them--on a hayrick. Then the rick was set on fire.\\nIt made us desperately wild, and we long to get at those Germans. If we\\nonly could have charged! As it was, we had to stay where we were, but I\\nthink we got in a good few shots of vengeance which found their billet.\\u201d\\n\\nA lieutenant of an infantry regiment stated that the Germans captured a\\nparty of his men outside Li\\xe9ge, and in order to prevent their escape\\ncrushed their feet with the butts of their rifles. They then took one\\nman and held him against a tree while their comrades beat him about the\\nback with rifle butts. An infantryman named Legrande, who was in the\\ntrenches beside his brother at a point where the fighting was furious,\\nand who is now in hospital at Brussels, told the following story. His\\nbrother was mortally wounded by a German bullet, and died in his arms.\\nHe himself was shot in the thigh, and almost at the same moment some\\nGerman Uhlans rode over him, leaving him unconscious. When he recovered\\nhis senses he made an endeavour to crawl back to his own lines, which in\\nthe meantime had been drawn in. He was discovered by some German\\ninfantrymen, who stripped him, taking his water-bottle and everything.\\nLegrande had to wait in a state of utter nudity until the middle of the\\nnight, and then strip the dead bodies of his comrades in order to clothe\\nhimself. Eventually he regained the ranks of his comrades in an almost\\ndying condition.\\n\\nAgain the Germans, having despoiled dead Belgian soldiers of their\\nuniforms, clothed some of their men in them and placed them at the head\\nof their troops when an attack was made upon the Belgian troops.\\n\\n\\nThe Khaki Uniform Trick.\\n\\nThe treacherous use by the Germans of British uniforms is instanced by\\none of the wounded men at present in England. \\u201cWhat made matters worse\\nfor us was the treachery of the enemy,\\u201d he stated, in the course of an\\naccount of the fight in which he had sustained his hurt. \\u201cWe were\\ncompelled to fall back at one point, and left behind us our haversacks\\nand greatcoats, which we had taken off to allow us to fight the better.\\nSome time afterwards a body of men came towards us wearing the familiar\\nkhaki-coloured coats, and naturally we took them for friends. But they\\nwere Germans who had seized our coats and put them on in order to\\ndisguise themselves, and no sooner were they near us than they sent a\\nmurderous fire into our ranks. Later, when there was a lull in the\\nfighting, we found a large number of Germans killed wearing the clothes\\nof British soldiers, showing that they must either have stripped our\\ndead or the British prisoners they had captured and used their clothes.\\u201d\\n\\nA number of Belgian soldiers arriving in Folkestone have also described\\nthe behaviour of the enemy as too brutal for any civilised nation, and\\nmost of them had seen Belgian villagers drawn in front of the Germans to\\nact as a screen for them. A favourite trick of the Germans was to\\nterrify Belgian villagers by driving them along immediately in front of\\ntheir heavy guns, where, owing to the elevation of the guns, they were\\nreally quite safe. Their experience had been that the Germans had no\\nrespect for the Red Cross, and that in fact they waited until the\\nwounded had been picked up and would then fire. They confirmed the\\nstories which had been told about the manner in which the Germans had\\nkilled wounded men.\\n\\nIn another case a French soldier, after the engagement at Spincourt,\\nrelated that while he was on the ground with a bullet in his foot the\\nGermans, seeing he was not dead, fired at him with a rifle, twice,\\npoint-blank, hitting him in the hip and shoulder, whereupon he became\\nunconscious. The Germans, thinking he was dead, left him.\\n\\nMany of the British wounded affirm that the Germans pay no respect to\\nthe Red Cross flag, but continually fire upon it and upon Red Cross men.\\nThe enemy have also frequently violated the rules of the white flag.\\nThese statements are supported by the Ostend correspondent of the\\nCentral News, who was the eye-witness of the disgraceful incident which\\nhe described in the following message:--\\u201cWhen I was in the neighbourhood\\nof Malines the forts were under bombardment. From the Willebroek fort\\nthe Belgians were placing shells into a wood four miles distant, with\\nthe object of forcing out a detachment of Uhlans. Presently a party of\\nUhlans, exhibiting a white flag, came forward towards the Belgian\\ntrenches with a request for a cessation of fire for the purpose of\\ncollecting wounded. The temporary truce was agreed to. A Red Cross wagon\\ncame forward to collect wounded, and a party from the Belgian trenches\\nwent out for a similar purpose.\\n\\n\\u201cSuddenly the German Red Cross van opened, and from out of it a\\nmitrailleuse poured its deadly fire with such effect that some ninety of\\nthe Belgians fell dead. The retribution was swift and complete. The\\nBelgian artillery again opened fire, and with well-directed shells laid\\nlow at least 200 of the treacherous Germans.\\n\\n\\u201cAnother incident of like character came beneath my immediate notice. A\\nparty of German cyclists, entering the village of Willebroek, shot down\\na child of seven years of age. The Belgian infantry opened fire upon the\\ncyclists, and an armoured motor-car, carrying a captain and four men,\\npursued the marauders. It is with satisfaction that I can record that\\neight of the Germans will fight no more.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nFrance Makes a Formal Protest.\\n\\nAn official _communiqu\\xe9_ issued by the War Office of Paris contains the\\nfollowing references to these outrages. It draws to the attention of the\\nPowers signatory of The Hague Convention the following facts,\\nconstituting on the part of the German military authorities a violation\\nof the Conventions signed on October 10th, 1907, by the Imperial German\\nGovernment:--\\n\\n\\u201cAccording to a report dated August 10th, 1914, sent by the General\\nCommanding the Army in the East,\\u201d it continues, \\u201cthe German troops have\\nfinished off a large number of wounded men by shots fired into their\\nfaces at close quarters, as has been demonstrated by the dimensions of\\nthe wounds. Other wounded men were deliberately trampled upon.\\n\\n\\u201cOn the 10th August the Bavarian infantry systematically set fire to the\\nvillages which they went through in Barbas, Montigny, Montreux, and\\nParuse districts, at a time also when no artillery fire on either side\\ncould have provoked such action. In the same district they compelled the\\ninhabitants to go in front of their scouts.\\u201d\\n\\nAnother report, dated August 11th, 1914, says: \\u201cThe German troops are\\nburning villages, massacring inhabitants, and making the women and\\nchildren march in front of them when they come out of the villages on to\\nthe battlefields. This was done notably at Billy, in the fighting on the\\n10th. They are finishing off the wounded and killing prisoners.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Government of the Republic, in view of such proceedings, which must\\nbe repudiated by the universal conscience of mankind, leaves it to the\\ncivilised Powers to make complete appreciation of these criminal acts,\\nwhich are eternally dishonouring for a belligerent.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI.\\n\\n     \\u201c=The wrong--I speak openly--that we are committing I will endeavour\\n     to make good as soon as our military goal is achieved.=\\u201d\\n\\n        From a speech by _The German Chancellor_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Antwerp Outrage.\\n\\nNext to the tragic and infamous destruction of Louvain, and the\\nattendant atrocities committed in that beautiful old town, nothing has\\ncalled forth more passionate denunciation than the cowardly attempt made\\nby Zeppelin airships to drop bombs at Antwerp in the dead of night on\\nits sleeping inhabitants. For the first time in history a death-dealing\\nairship has attacked a city in this way. As a weapon the Zeppelin\\ndropping bombs may be as destructive as great shells fired from siege\\nhowitzers. The horror of aircraft is, however, more terrorizing than\\nthat of any siege gun, because bombs can be thrown down from the sky on\\ndefenceless and sleeping cities. The civilized world has greeted with\\nexecration this inhuman method of prosecuting war.\\n\\nBefore even a fortified town can be bombarded, the rules of war provide\\nfor twenty-four hours\\u2019 notice before the commencement of actual\\nbombardment. Here we have a great airship sailing high over a sleeping\\ncity. Without warning her crew drop death-dealing bombs from the sky in\\nthe dead of night. Surely the killing of unsuspecting men, innocent\\nwomen, and sleeping children in this way is the most ruthless outrage\\never attempted in war.\\n\\nPiloted by a German who knew the city well--one of the many to whom the\\ncity opened wide its doors in the days before the war--the huge airship\\nhad for its objective the Palais du Roi, where the Queen of Belgium, the\\nlittle Princes, and Princess Marie-Jos\\xe9 lay sleeping. Aided by the\\ndarkness, the crew of the Zeppelin felt confident of their ability to\\ncarry out their murderous programme. They had mapped out a career of\\nterrifying destruction. In a track of devastation they meant to leave in\\nruins the Palais du Roi (which would also have involved the death of the\\nRoyal Family), the Bourse, the Palais de Justice, the Banque, and the\\nMinerva Motor Works. But in no case was the treacherous aim attained.\\nThe cowardly raid proved a complete and utter failure, the only\\nconsolation provided the Kaiser being the slaughter of seven innocent\\npersons and the wounding of some twenty others.\\n\\n\\nGirls Horribly Mutilated.\\n\\nThe bombs which were to have killed the Queen and her family and to have\\nshattered the Bourse fell into an adjoining street, wrecked a house, and\\ninjured two women. That destined for the destruction of the Banque\\nstruck the attic of a house near by, killed a servant as she slept, and\\ninjured two others. Of the other bombs one fell into a shrubbery, dug a\\ndeep, funnel-shaped hole, uprooted shrubs, and plucked from their frames\\nwindows of the St. Elizabeth Hospital, where the wounded lay.\\nAnother--and the most successful bomb--struck a private house inhabited\\nby poor people, murdered a woman, and horribly mutilated three girls,\\nkilled two Civic Guards, and seriously injured another. It was at a\\nprivate house just off the Place de Meir that a bomb wrought much\\ndestruction to life and property. It tore off the top storey and split\\nup the front.\\n\\n\\nScreams of Dying Women.\\n\\n\\u201cAs I arrived on the scene,\\u201d says a _Daily Telegraph_ correspondent, \\u201ca\\nwoman tottered out covered with lime dust, crying out, \\u2018Docteur,\\ndocteur!\\u2019 Beneath the ruins of the house two Civic Guards were dead.\\nWithin the house pitiful screams came from three girls who had been\\nroused from sleep by receiving dreadful wounds on the face and body. One\\ngirl had half her face blown away; the two others were seriously wounded\\non the face. Evidently their bodies had been somewhat protected by the\\nbed-clothes.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Zeppelin at the time of this appalling incident was almost\\nstationary in the sky, some seven hundred feet from the ground. Needless\\nto say, a panic at once ensued, and thousands of people took refuge in\\ntheir cellars, while others dashed out into the streets in their night\\nattire. Time after time the earth trembled as the terrible bombs fell,\\ncausing devastation everywhere, the spots being signalled, it is said,\\nfrom the roofs of houses occupied by prominent Germans, of whom there\\nwas a large colony in Antwerp. Truly it was a night of terror, for the\\npopulace through the hours of tension did not know from one moment to\\nanother that they might not be blown to atoms. Ten bombs struck ten\\ndifferent streets. One which fell in the Rue des Navets made a hole six\\nfeet six inches in diameter and twenty-two inches deep. It was probably\\nfilled with shot, for all the houses in the vicinity were riddled by\\nbullets, and presented the appearance of having been fired upon, all the\\ndoors and windows being broken and the ceilings having fallen in.\\n\\n     \\u201c=The best protection of undefended cities against German Zeppelins\\n     is that a repetition of the Antwerp occurrence will be greeted with\\n     execration by the whole civilized world.=\\u201d--_Times._\\n\\n\\nEnormous Damage to Property.\\n\\nIt was calculated that about nine hundred houses were more or less\\ndamaged and about sixty houses destroyed. In a single house four persons\\nwere found dead. Indeed, in one room two people had been blown to atoms.\\nThree men were walking in the Rue de la Corne, when one of the bombs\\nfell. One was killed and the other two mortally wounded, while another\\npasser-by had his leg blown off. All the bombs, which created a terrific\\nexplosion, were found to have been in a steel cover one and a half\\ninches thick and about a foot in diameter. The Zeppelin was, of course,\\nfired upon from the forts with guns and rifles, but having launched its\\ndeadly missiles it moved off into the darkness.\\n\\nA subsequent examination of the projectiles thrown showed that they had\\na double covering, the two covers being joined together by\\nmushroom-shaped rivets, which act the part of bullets, and must cause\\nhorrible injuries, as the two covers or envelopes are torn to fragments\\nby the explosive.\\n\\n     \\u201c=If Germany had fought fairly we should have retained the respect\\n     for her which we had in the past; but her barbarous method of\\n     conducting war by sea and land has made all the nations of the Old\\n     World and the New regard her as the enemy of the human race.=\\u201d\\n\\n        --MILITARY CORRESPONDENT of _The Times_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Miraculous Escape.\\n\\nThe story of that terrible night would not, however, be complete without\\na reference to the miraculous escape of M. Vamberg, a cigarette-maker.\\nHad he slept in the bed he usually occupied, he would now be a dead man.\\nBut for some reason he chose another bed in another room, his wife being\\nabsent in the country, and so saved his life. The bed which Mme. Vamberg\\noccupies when at home was crushed by the falling roof. More than that,\\nhaving been aroused by the sound of the cannon, and having jumped out of\\nbed and rushed down to the first floor, M. Vamberg found himself\\nsuddenly hanging from the window, the house having fallen about his\\nears. He was rescued from this position by the firemen.\\n\\n\\nMore Cowardly Raids.\\n\\nBut, as though not satisfied with the success of the first attempt, the\\nGermans determined upon another dastardly raid. A few nights after the\\nfirst outrage a Zeppelin again appeared over the city in the dead of\\nnight. Ten bombs were discharged, and damaged a number of houses. No\\nlives were lost, however. A boy of fifteen had his right arm injured by\\na flying splinter, while his father and sister and one or two others\\nwere slightly injured. A graphic description of the raid is given by the\\n_Daily Telegraph_ correspondent. \\u201cI was awakened,\\u201d he relates, \\u201cby the\\nrattle of rifle-fire from neighbouring roofs and the hideous crash of\\nexploding bombs. Hurriedly descending into the Place Verte, I was just\\nin time to see an airship disappearing southward. She was at a\\ntremendous height, but could be clearly seen in the rays of the\\nsearchlight. There was an incessant rattle of shots from rifles and\\nmachine guns from the darkened town, and shrapnel could be seen\\nexploding like meteorites in the trail of the flying marauder. All round\\nthe Place Verte from the roadway, and from points of vantage on the high\\nbuildings, spurts of flame indicated the efforts of the firers to bring\\ndown the hated ship. Immediately the searchlights fixed upon her the\\nZeppelin made off at great speed.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nWorse than the Boxers.\\n\\nSurgeon-Major Seaman, of the United States Army Reserve Corps, who\\nhelped to tend the wounded, was so indignant with these cowardly tactics\\non the part of the Germans that he communicated with his Government,\\nasking it to join at once in exacting reparation from Germany for such\\ninfamies. He declared that in all his eight campaigns, of which one was\\nagainst the Boxers in China, he had never seen an act of war so\\nruthless, so horrible, as the sight of three young girls mutilated and\\ndefaced, and of the dead young mother, all attacked in their beds at\\nnight. And with him the civilized world will agree.\\n\\nOther airship and aeroplane raids were made on Antwerp and also upon\\nParis, but fortunately none has been attended with either great loss of\\nlife or destruction of property. But that such should be the case\\naffords no excuse for crimes which rank among the greatest committed by\\nthe ruthless German army.\\n\\n     \\u201c=At this moment the words \\u2018German culture\\u2019 are synonymous for\\n     rapine, murder, and hideous cruelty. This is a state of things\\n     which ought to be grasped by the people of Germany.=\\u201d\\n\\n        --From the _Morning Post_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII.\\n\\n     \\u201c=Against ordinary though severe reprisals upon civilians who have\\n     fired upon the German troops we have not a word to utter; but\\n     outrage, mutilation, burning alive, and so forth are not reprisals;\\n     they are atrocities which make the name of Germany stink in the\\n     nostrils of mankind. It is hard to believe that a civilized nation\\n     should have so reverted to savagery, but unfortunately the facts\\n     admit of no dispute.=\\u201d--From the _Globe_.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cThe Hussar-like Stroke.\\u201d\\n\\nThe laying of mines in neutral waters in contravention of the rules by\\nwhich civilized warfare was to be conducted was in itself a most\\ndastardly act. To place contact mines in the open sea and then to skulk\\nbehind them was declared by the Kaiser\\u2019s wireless press bureau to be a\\n\\u201cHussar-like stroke.\\u201d The Kaiser himself referred with satisfaction to\\nthe fact that his navy had sown the North Sea with death. The laying of\\nmines is only admissible for the purpose of guarding estuaries and\\nharbours, and by The Hague Convention it was specifically laid down that\\nneutral waters must not be mined. In consequence of this cruel action of\\nthe enemy many crews of British and Danish trawlers, the hard toilers of\\nthe sea, were sent to their deaths, while the Wilson liner _Runo_, on a\\nvoyage to Archangel, and His Majesty\\u2019s ships _Amphion_ and _Speedy_ were\\nsent to the bottom with great loss of life. In addition, several\\ntrawlers, while engaged in mine-sweeping operations, were also\\ndestroyed. All craft and cunning in naval warfare was, of course,\\nadmissible, including the alteration and extinguishing of lights, the\\nremoval of landmarks and buoys, and the disguising of warships as\\nmerchantmen; but to scatter death indiscriminately along a neutral\\nwaterway was a stab-in-the-back method worthy, indeed, of the pinchbeck\\nNapoleon.\\n\\n=Such is the case against the German Soldier--the terrible and\\noverwhelming record which makes the very heart sick with horror, and the\\nblood run chill. One of our great poets called upon the human race to\\n\\u201cmove upward, working out the beast, and let the ape and tiger die.\\u201d\\nApes and tigers are noble creatures beside the living apostle of German\\n\\u201cculture.\\u201d He has built himself a monument upon the heights of infamy, a\\nmonument from which, through all the ages yet to come, every honest man\\nwill turn away in loathing and disgust.=\\n\\n     =JOHN RUSKIN\\u2019S words:=--\\n\\n     \\u201c=For blessing is only for the meek and merciful, and a German\\n     cannot be either; he does not understand even the meaning of the\\n     words ... but a German, selfish in the purest states of virtue and\\n     morality ... but no quantity of learning ever makes a German\\n     modest....=\\n\\n     \\u201c=Accordingly, when the Germans get command of Lombardy, they\\n     bombard Venice, steal her pictures (which they can\\u2019t understand a\\n     single touch of), and entirely ruin the country, morally and\\n     physically, leaving behind them misery, vice, and intense hatred of\\n     themselves, wherever their accursed feet have trodden. They do\\n     precisely the same thing by France--crush her, rob her, leave her\\n     in misery of rage and shame, and return home, smacking their lips,\\n     and singing Te Deums.=\\u201d--_Fors Clavigera._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DAY\\n\\nBy THE \\u201cBATH RAILWAY POET\\u201d\\n\\n     [This very striking poem, which we reproduce below by kind\\n     permission of the _Daily Express_, is published in leaflet form at\\n     a halfpenny, for the benefit of the National Relief Fund.
