"Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as ""historical"" in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer ""wonder tales"" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale.","[3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 6, 6, 3, 11, 3, 3, 2, 7, 2, 10, 2, 3, 8, 2, 7, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 5, 2, 5, 3, 11, 5, 5, 3, 5, 3, 10, 8, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 14, 9, 7, 2, 5, 7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 5, 2, 4, 4]",298
Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.,"[6, 9, 8, 8, 9, 3, 6, 5, 5, 4, 13, 2, 3, 6, 5, 3, 6, 9, 4, 3, 12, 8]",137
