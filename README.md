# Visual Novel Processing 

## Question
How can I use data science and popular novels to improve my own novels? 

What are the patterns of popular novels when taking into consideration certain elements such as tone, emotion, the variance of sentence length, and structure?

## Known Data
The first novel I've chosen to explore using data science is the *Wizard of Oz*. It is the novel that Christopher Vogler uses as an example in his book *The Writers Journey*. He explains how the story follows the hero's journey as taught by mythologist Joseph Campbell. 

After breaking the *Wizard of Oz* up into twenty pieces and running a sentiment analyses on the individual pieces I discovered that the dips and rises in sentiment follow Michael Hauge's Six Stage Plot Structure.

I'm excited to explore and compare other novels and the patterns they make. You can find a rough draft of my project paper here. [Draft Paper - in progress](https://github.com/ravenruckus/novel_processing/blob/master/wizardofoz/draft_paper.ipynb)

I'm in the process of exploring several popular novels from the [Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) and plan to cluster them by their content and compare their sentiment patterns.


## In the Future

In the future as this project expands and progresses I hope to be able to predict whether a novel will be popular. 

## Why This Project?

I chose this topic because I have been attempting to write novels for a long time and have read and studied a decent amount about it and still feel overwhelmed with the process of novel creation.

I also would like to be able to use the tools and methods I discover here to go through all of my raw writings and piece them together into a readable form. Also my grandparents left me 50 taped recordings of interviews they did of individuals in the  mining town of Seria City. I would like to eventually transcribe those and make a historical record and a fictional tale. 

After studying and thinking about story structure for over a decade as a hobby, looking at novels through the lens of data science is a whole knew experience and as a side benefit I think it is engraining into me the natural flow and structure that novels take on. It will be exciting if this shows in my natural writing flow.
