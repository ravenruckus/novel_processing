# Visual Novel Processing 

## Question

What are the visual patterns of popular novels when taking into consideration certain elements such as tone, emotion, the variance of sentence length, and structure?

## Known Data

The first novel I would like to use is the *Wizard of Oz*. It is the novel that Christopher Vogler uses as an example in his book *The Writers Journey*. He explains how the story follows the hero's journey as taught by mythologist Joseph Campbell. 

Later I would also like to use Alice in Wonderland and The Hobbit to see how they compare visually and statistically to the Wizard of Oz. Then I would like to compare my raw novels that I wrote for National Novel Writing Month to see how they visually compare.  My plan is to be able to rewrite my novels and see if by getting them to compare more closely visually to well written novels if then they will be more readable. 

## My Plan So Far

I plan to break the Wizard of Oz, as closely as I can, down into the twelve stages of the Hero's Journey as outlined by Vogler and Campbell. 

1. Ordinary World
2. Call to Adventure
3. Refusal of the Call
4. Meeting with the Mentor
5. Crossing the First Threshold
6. Test, Allies, Enemies
7. Approach to the Inmost Cave
8. Ordeal
9. Reward (Seizing the Sword)
10. The Road Back
11. Resurrection
12. Return with the Elixir

I will then measure in each individual section sentence length and other elements I decide upon like emotion. 

## Why This Project?

I chose this topic because I have been attempting to write novels for a long time and have read and studied a decent amount about it and still feel overwhelmed with the process of novel creation.

I also would like to be able to use something like this to go through all of my raw writings and piece them together into a readable form. Also my grandparents left me 50 taped recordings of   interviews they did of individuals in the  mining own of Seria City. I would like to eventually transcribe those and make a historical record and a fictional tale.
